(<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314\">#22314</a>).</li>\n<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949\">#30949</a>).</li>\n<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined.

This post isn&#8217;t going to be about <a href=\"http://heropress.com/about/\">HeroPress</a> nor about <a href=\"http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/\">my adventures on the trip</a>. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.</p>\n<h2>The Similarities</h2>\n<p>In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.</p>\n<p>Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.</p>\n<p>It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&#8217;s an example of a room:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509\" alt=\"WordCamp Pune Classrooms\" /></a>Here&#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Differences</h2>\n<p>This is the first WordCamp I&#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of <em>local</em> languages was fascinating to me.</p>\n<p>The unofficial time zone of India is <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/\">Indian Stretchable Time</a>. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.</p>\n<p>The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was <strong>not expected</strong>. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.</p>\n<p>Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510\" alt=\"Indian Policemen\" /></a>Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.</p>\n<h2>The Word Lounge</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-48220\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462\" alt=\"Word Lounge\" /></a> There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&#8217;s a local group called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_%28dish%29\">Alphabet Sambar</a> (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.</p>\n<p>I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.</p>\n<h2>The After Party</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crccpune\">Classic Rock Coffee Co.</a> offered both.</p>\n<p>It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.</p>\n<p>I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.</p>\n<p>Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.</p>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia#gallery-48212-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<h2>Bits and Pieces</h2>\n<p>The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.</p>\n<p>There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-48226\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578\" alt=\"Crazy Hat Picture\" /></a></p>\n<p>Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.</p>\n<p>Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.</p>\n<p>The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and <strong>that</strong> is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.</p>\n<p>If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 02:50:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"Post Status: Justifying conferences, improving WordPress comments, and WordPress’s PHP version support — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"https://poststatus.com/justifying-conferences-improving-wordpress-comments-and-wordpresss-php-version-support-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2719:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/\">than last year</a>. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&#8217;s survey has 25 questions.</p>\n<p>A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.</p>\n<h2>Highlights From the Survey</h2>\n<p>The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.</p>\n<p>In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48182\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249\" alt=\"bbPress 2015 Survey Users\" /></a>bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress\n<p>For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.</p>\n<p>The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48183\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237\" alt=\"bbPress User Installations\" /></a>bbPress User Installations\n<p>One statistic I&#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328\" alt=\"How People Found Out About The Survey\" /></a>The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.</p>\n<p>For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48196\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219\" alt=\"2015 Most Requested Features\" /></a>2015 Most Requested Features\n<h2>The Future of bbPress</h2>\n<p>Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The <a href=\"https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt\">bbPress core team</a> has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.</p>\n<p>While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/\">@johnjamesjacoby</a> formally started the process when he <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/\">posted the results of an audit</a> to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The project involves multiple teams including, the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">WP Support team</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">WP Meta Team</a>. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 20:54:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48173\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1427:\"<p>When WPML emailed new <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext\">passwords to customers in plaintext</a>, some customers thought it was due to a security breach.

We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&#8221; Kvint said.</p>\n<p>The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords.

Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Dear Matt</b>,</p>\n<p>We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.</p>\n<p>Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.</p>\n<p>All the best,</p>\n<p><b>WPML team</b></p></blockquote>\n<p>Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&#8221; WPML said.</p>\n<p>When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&#8217;re salted and hashed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says <a href=\"https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143\">the email was generated automatically</a> from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. <a href=\"https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/</a></p>\n<p>You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WPML has not published any information on <a href=\"https://wpml.org/blog/\">its blog</a> that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.</p>\n<p>Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/\">WordPress no longer emails passwords</a>.

It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.</p>\n<p>It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing.

In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.<br />\n<strong>Self-Closing</strong>: [{{shortcode}}]</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: [{{shortcode attr1=&#8221;value1&#8243; attr2=&#8217;value2&#8242; &#8220;value3&#8221; &#8216;value4&#8217; value5}}]</p>\n<p><strong>Enclosing</strong>: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Enclosures</strong>: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]</p>\n<p><strong>Escaped Code</strong>: [!{{shortcode}}]</p>\n<p>In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.</p>\n<p>During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.</p>\n<p>An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6</p>\n<p>The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.</p>\n<h2>The Proposal Raises Concerns</h2>\n<p>The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426\">voiced his concern</a> saying the syntax isn&#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://halfelf.org/\">Mika Epstein</a>, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472\">sums up a list of concerns</a> that many developers agree with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now <code>{{gallery}}</code>. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that <em>do not</em> get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518\">made by Stefano Agiletti.</a> Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].</p>\n<p>To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Back to the Drawing Board</h2>\n<p>After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484\">summarizing the feedback</a>, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.</p>\n<p>At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that <strong>we still need to do something</strong>, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I highly encourage you to read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/\">proposal and the comments</a> that follow it. It&#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Sep 2015 21:16:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 206 – Stream Reverts to its Old Ways\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-206-stream-reverts-to-its-old-ways\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2645:\"<p>In this week&#8217;s episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the news of the week including, Envato&#8217;s new item support policy, Twenty Sixteen available on GitHub, and BuddyPress 2.3.3.

That&#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.</p>\n<p>At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&#8217;ve created a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/comment-policy\">comment moderation policy</a>. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.</p>\n<p>The policy is <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0 licensed</a> which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</h2>\n<p>We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.</p>\n<p>Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.</p>\n<p>We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.</p>\n<p>Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.</p>\n<p>Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advocates an illegal practice</li>\n<li>Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language</li>\n<li>Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise</li>\n<li>Is written anonymously</li>\n<li>Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site</li>\n<li>Impersonates another user</li>\n<li>Contains an affiliate link</li>\n<li>Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">How Do I Report Comments?</h2>\n<p>If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/contact-me\">contact us</a>. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.</p>\n<p>Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.</p>\n<h2>The Goal</h2>\n<p>The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Sep 2015 06:36:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14173\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6733:\"<p><a href=\"http://feelingrestful.com/\">A Day of REST</a> will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.</p>\n<p>The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>This is exactly the kind of event I&#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.</p>\n<p>It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.</p>\n<p>The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.</p>\n<h3>Who is speaking at A Day of REST</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg\" alt=\"speakers-day-of-rest\" width=\"752\" height=\"603\" /></p>\n<p>The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ryan McCue &#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead</li>\n<li>Joe Hoyle &#8211; WordPress REST API team</li>\n<li>Daniel Bachhuber &#8211; WordPress REST API team</li>\n<li>Kathleen Vignos &#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED</li>\n<li>K. Adam White &#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup</li>\n<li>Jack Lenox &#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic</li>\n<li>Scott Taylor &#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times</li>\n<li>Nikolay Bachiyski &#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Post Status will be an official partner</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.</p>\n<h3>So who is organizing?</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg\" alt=\"humans\" width=\"752\" height=\"333\" /></p>\n<p>A Day of REST is organized by <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/\">Human Made</a>, who’ve brought on board <a href=\"http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/\">Siobhan McKeown</a> to lead the charge putting the event together.</p>\n<p>Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmccue\">Ryan McCue</a> is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle\">Joe Hoyle</a> is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.</p>\n<h3>Hack Day</h3>\n<p>On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.</p>\n<h3>Ticket details</h3>\n<p>Tickets are available <a href=\"http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/\">from the website</a>. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp; booking fees) &#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.</p>\n<h3>Confirmed sponsors</h3>\n<p>A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://prospress.com/\">ProsPress</a> &#8211; Gold sponsor</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gravityforms.com/\">Gravity Forms</a> &#8211; Gold sponsor</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> &#8211; Gold sponsor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen.

Earlier today, <a href=\"http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/\">Envato implemented</a> an <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy\">Item Support Policy</a> for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.</p>\n<p>When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47991\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408\" alt=\"This Item is Supported\" /></a>This Item is Supported\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy\">the policy</a>, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.</p>\n<p>The price of a <b>6-month support extension</b> for a <b>Regular License</b> is calculated as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;</li>\n<li>62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and</li>\n<li>87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.</p>\n<h2>Disgruntled Authors</h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619\">forum thread</a> with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01\">Jonathan Atkinson</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://cr3ativ.com/\">Cr3ativ</a>, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The policy is a work in progress, &#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&#8221; Freeman said.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Sep 2015 00:52:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: On VentureBeat Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45294\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://ma.tt/2015/08/on-venturebeat-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:303:\"<p>I was on VentureBeat&#8217;s podcast with Dylan Tweeney, <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/08/11/how-matt-mullenweg-built-wordpress-into-a-giant-platform-powering-14-of-the-web-podcast/\">talking a bit about how WordPress came to be and geeking out on some of the tech behind our approach</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Sep 2015 02:23:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47973\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2332:\"<p>Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/\">WordPress theme directory</a>.

It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.</p>\n<h2>My User Experience</h2>\n<p>One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like <a href=\"https://dailypost.wordpress.com/\">The Daily Post</a>.</p>\n<p>What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.</p>\n<p>I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.</p>\n<p>For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?</p>\n<p>If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 07:43:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Frequent Flyer Syndrome\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45311\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"http://ma.tt/2015/08/frequent-flyer-syndrome/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:175:\"<p>It turns out <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/08/frequent-flyers\">not everything about traveling all the time is roses</a>.

Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service\">version two was released</a> nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.</p>\n<p>Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on <strong>October 1st</strong>. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.</p>\n<h2>The Cloud is Expensive</h2>\n<p>Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.</p>\n<h2>XWP to The Rescue</h2>\n<p>With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&#8221; Carbis said.</p>\n<p>Members from <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s New in Stream 3</h2>\n<p>Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.</p>\n<p>Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please <a href=\"https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/\">review the following FAQ</a>.</p>\n<h2>A New Direction</h2>\n<p>Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/\">proposed roadmap</a> is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&#8217;s future, &#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either.

Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&#8217;t look as modern as <a href=\"https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/\">Twenty Fifteen</a> out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.</p>\n<p>If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">SlackHQ</a>. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.</p>\n<p>What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 01:20:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Sessions From BuddyCamp Brighton, UK Now Available to Watch on WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=47892\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://wptavern.com/sessions-from-buddycamp-brighton-uk-now-available-to-watch-on-wordpress-tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1354:\"<p>Earlier this month, the first <a href=\"https://brighton.buddycamp.org/2015/\">BuddyCamp Brighton, UK</a> successfully took place.

They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign\">Friends of Pods</a> initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&#8221; Burge told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the <a href=\"http://appalachiantrail.com/\">Appalachian Trail</a> website.

She knows me as &#8220;dad&#8221;, but when she gets older she&#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.</p>\n<p>If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and <a href=\"http://alexking.org/contact\">send it to me</a> or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.</p>\n<p class=\"threads-post-notice\">This post is part of the thread: <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer\">Cancer</a> &#8211; an ongoing story on this site.

My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.</p>\n<p>There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.</p>\n<h2>WordPress For a Better Future</h2>\n<p>In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?</p>\n<p>I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.</p>\n<p>Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.</li>\n<li>Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.</li>\n<li>Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.</li>\n<li>Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.</p>\n<h2>What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?</h2>\n<p>The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.</p>\n<p>I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.</p>\n<p>On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.</p>\n<p>The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.</p>\n<p>The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.</p>\n<h2>The Indecent World of WordPress Experts</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-39089\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200\" alt=\"Job Titles Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971\">I love &#8217;84</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.</p>\n<p>In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.</p>\n<p>The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of <em>WordPress experts</em>. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.</p>\n<p>Next on the list are <em>WordPress developers</em>. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.</p>\n<p>Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.</p>\n<p>Tom McFarlin <a href=\"http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/\">published a post</a> on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore\">various technical skills in the WordPress context</a>. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.</p>\n<p>I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.</p>\n<p>That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.</p>\n<p>What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.</p>\n<h2>The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs</h2>\n<p>As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?</p>\n<p>We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.</p>\n<p>None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.</p>\n<p>If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.</p>\n<p>There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.</p>\n<h2>What is a Successful Client?</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-32204\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278\" alt=\"Success Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/\">seeveeaar</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p><a href=\"http://prestigeconf.com/\">Prestige Conference</a> happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from <a href=\"https://tri.be/\">Modern Tribe</a> shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.</p>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”</p>\n<p>As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.</p>\n<p>Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T</p>\n<p>hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.</p>\n<p>Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.</p>\n<h2>How to Target Successful Clients</h2>\n<p>Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.</p>\n<p>I have identified some steps for <a href=\"http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/\">moving from a freelancer to a successful company</a>. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.</p>\n<h2>WordPress is a Vague Term</h2>\n<p>Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.</p>\n<p>Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.</p>\n<p>Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Installments Don’t Matter</h2>\n<p>Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Imagine what will happen if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.</li>\n<li>You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.</li>\n<li>Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.</li>\n<li>You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.</p>\n<p>At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It</h2>\n<p>Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.</p>\n<p>If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.</p>\n<p>Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.</p>\n<h2>Context-Specific WordPress Solutions</h2>\n<p>Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.</p>\n<p>In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.</p>\n<p>As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.</p>\n<p>The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.</p>\n<p>All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.</p>\n<p>Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.</p>\n<h2>Solving More Complex Problems</h2>\n<p>In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.</p>\n<p>If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>\n<p>In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.</p>\n<p>You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.</p>\n<p>It’s just as they say at a music college &#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.</p>\n<h2>Teaming Up</h2>\n<p>If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.</p>\n<p>If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.</p>\n<p>This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.</p>\n<h2>Security Concerns</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44224\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368\" alt=\"Hello Security Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046\">Two Locks</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.</p>\n<p>While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?</p>\n<h2>Organization and Accountability</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47877\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400\" alt=\"BrainyQuote\" /></a>BrainyQuote\n<p>In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.</p>\n<p>Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.</p>\n<p>They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.</p>\n<p>Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.</p>\n<p>Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments.

More than a year in the making, 3.0 has over 269 commits and a slew of new features.</p>\n<p>After the release of Hybrid Core 2.0 last year, Tadlock assumed it would be at least two years before he tackled another major release, &#8220;I’d planned on doing minor and patch releases for a while, all along building themes,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, a lot has changed in the theming world in just the past year. WordPress has added a lot of cool features for theme authors that were previously handled by Hybrid Core,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>Tadlock wants the project to feel fresh and one way to do that is to remove features that are handled natively by WordPress. Features removed from Hybrid Core include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Atomic hooks functionality.</li>\n<li>Random Custom Background extension.</li>\n<li>Featured Header extension.</li>\n<li>Cleaner Caption extension (handled in WP).</li>\n<li>Loop title/description (replaced by WP).</li>\n<li>Pagination (replaced by WP).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/\">customizer in WordPress is here to stay</a> and will be an important part of the project&#8217;s future. Hybrid Core 3.0 adds a variety of enhancements that make the customizer more flexible, these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Color Palette.</li>\n<li>Multiple Checkbox.</li>\n<li>Dropdown Terms.</li>\n<li>Layout.</li>\n<li>Radio Image.</li>\n<li>Select Group.</li>\n<li>Multiple Select.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a few customizer setting classes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Array Map.</li>\n<li>Image Data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tadlock Experiments with Community-driven Documentation</h2>\n<p>One of the largest changes to the Hybrid project is opening up documentation to be community-driven. The <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/wiki\">Hybrid Core wiki</a> hosted on Github is now open to contributions from the community.</p>\n<p>Tadlock believes that this will drive adoption of the framework by more theme authors, &#8220;The more developers we have using and contributing to the project, the better,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>If the community responds well to the experiment, it will allow Tadlock to focus on longer-form tutorials for club members, something he feels he&#8217;s better at doing than reference style documentation.</p>\n<p>Hybrid Core 3.0 includes a number of features, bug fixes, and improvements.

This release features menus in the customizer, strong passwords by default, site icons, and variety of other improvements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>\n<p>You can now create, add, and edit menus in the customizer while previewing changes to your site in real-time. Unlike other parts of the customizer, previewing menus should be fast as it uses a new hybrid transport layer. Weston Ruter, who contributed to fast previews in the customizer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/\">explains the approach</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We also wanted to enable fast previewing of menu changes by default. So we implemented a <code>postMessage</code>/<code>refresh</code> hybrid approach which uses <code>postMessage</code> to sync the menus settings to the preview, and then the preview does an Ajax request to render just the contents of the menu container, and this Ajax response is then inserted into the DOM to replace the previous menu container. The technical name for this approach we have been calling &#8216;partial refresh&#8217;, but you can call it fast preview.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In general, previewing menus in most themes should be a fast experience.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47806\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568\" alt=\"Menu Customizer\" /></a>Menu Customizer\n<h2>Strong Passwords by Default</h2>\n<p>Mark Jaquith <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/\">led the effort</a> to improve the way passwords are chosen and changed in WordPress. On the account management page, clicking the Generate Password button generates a strong password by default. The password strength meter is better integrated into the password field which lets users know immediately when their password is weak.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47807\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png?resize=1010%2C568\" alt=\"Better Passwords in WordPress\" /></a>Better Passwords in WordPress\n<p>The same interface is on the add new user screen, the password reset screen, and the WordPress install screen. While WordPress doesn&#8217;t require users to have a strong password, it does everything it can to encourage users to choose one.</p>\n<p>In addition, WordPress no longer emails passwords and password reset links expire after 24 hours. When your password or e-mail changes, WordPress sends you an email so if someone hijacks your browser session and changes these items, you’ll be notified that it happened, and you can take action. You can disable these e-mails via the <code>send_pass_change_email</code> and <code>send_email_change_email</code> filters by setting them to false.</p>\n<h2>Site Icons</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this\">Site Icons</a> are images that represent a website across multiple platforms. You can configure your Site Icon in the Site Identity panel within the customizer where you can upload a 512X512 sized image. This image will be used for browsers, iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices when a visitor bookmarks your site.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47808\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568\" alt=\"Site Icons in The Customizer\" /></a>Site Icons in The Customizer\n<h2>Text Patterns, Quick Link Toolbar, and Word Count Changes</h2>\n<p>The editor in WordPress 4.3 has <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3\">undergone more improvements</a> with text shortcuts, a quick link toolbar, and word count changes. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.</p>\n<p>When starting a new paragraph with one of these formatting shortcuts followed by a space, the formatting will be applied automatically. Press Backspace or Escape to undo.</p>\n<p>In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing <code>*</code> or <code>-</code> and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing <code>1. </code> or  <code>1)</code> and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don’t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting <code>ctrl/cmd+z</code> or <code>esc</code> will undo the text pattern.</p>\n<p>Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs <code>#</code> will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol <code>&gt;</code> will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>## = H2</li>\n<li>### = H3</li>\n<li>#### = H4</li>\n<li>##### = H5</li>\n<li>###### = H6</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quick Link Preview Toolbar</h3>\n<p>When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47792\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102\" alt=\"Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3\" /></a>Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3\n<p>Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn’t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/\">lists other notable changes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Changes to the Admin Bar</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.3 moves the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-46995 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232\" alt=\"WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar\" /></a>WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-46996 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202\" alt=\"WP43AdminBar\" /></a>WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar\n<p>The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress.

Among the enhancements to the visual editor are text patterns. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.</p>\n<p>In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing <code>*</code> or <code>-</code> and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing <code>1. </code> or  <code>1)</code> and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don&#8217;t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting <code>ctrl/cmd+z</code> or <code>esc</code> will undo the text pattern.</p>\n<p>Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs <code>#</code> will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol <code>&gt;</code> will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>## = H2</li>\n<li>### = H3</li>\n<li>#### = H4</li>\n<li>##### = H5</li>\n<li>###### = H6</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It took a few tries to figure out but once I got the hang of it, I discovered that I prefer using text patterns versus clicking the appropriate button in the editor.</p>\n<p>For example, the blockquote text pattern places text into a blockquote and automatically closes it while also starting a new paragraph. Traditionally, I highlight text and click on the blockquote button in the editor. Often times, I have to visit the text editor and close the blockquote to start a new paragraph.</p>\n<p>Ryan Boren, WordPress core lead developer, created the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/01/editor-enhancements-in-4-3-%E2%9C%A8/\">following video</a> which shows the text patterns in action on a mobile device.</p>\n<h2>Quick Previews of Links</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.2 included a subtle but convenient feature for adding links to text. Pasting the URL to highlighted text automatically turns it into a link. The problem is that there isn&#8217;t an easy way to preview the URL without opening it in a new browser tab.</p>\n<p>When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47792\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102\" alt=\"Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3\" /></a>Preview Links in The WordPress 4.3 Visual Editor\n<h2>Changes to Word and Character Counts</h2>\n<p>Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn&#8217;t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/\">lists other notable changes</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>character</strong> count, we no longer exclude any of these characters. This means that numbers and common western punctuation are no longer excluded compared to 4.2. Emoji and other astral characters are now counted as one character instead of two.</li>\n<li>We added a new type <strong>all</strong>, in addition to words and characters, that will count characters including spaces. This seemed necessary for Japanese and maybe other languages. This is now <code>character_including_spaces</code> and <code>character_excluding_spaces</code>.</li>\n<li>Shortcodes and HTML comments are now excluded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To view details and a summary of all the work that went into improving word counts, check out <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30966\">ticket #30966</a> on trac. As someone who uses the WordPress content editor for a living, I&#8217;m anxiously looking forward to utilizing these enhancements on an everyday basis.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 22:13:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Post Status: A WordPress conference for higher education: coming to a campus near you?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8684:\"<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: Thus far, there have been numerous niche WordPress conferences aiming toward for-profit initiatives and geared toward businesses, marketers, or eCommerce site owners.

What follows is her pitch and public brainstorming session on what a <a href=\"http://wordcampus.org/\">higher education focused WordPress conference</a> might look like.</em></p>\n<p>This all started with a tweet.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ooh. Dream with me: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash\">#WordCampus</a>: A WordCamp for folks using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash\">#WordPress</a> in Higher Education.\" I like it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash\">#heweb</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B\">https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648\">August 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WordCamp U.S. made a big announcement that was all over Twitter, Chris Lema tweeted what we were all thinking, and I couldn’t help but start daydreaming about the possibilities.</p>\n<p>You see, I’m a web designer and developer with a passion for all things WordPress, especially using WordPress to build the world of higher ed web. Having spent the last 8 years working in higher education, I’m always looking for ways to utilize the power of WordPress to fulfill my campus’s needs and to help its communication grow, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its new API capabilities to share information, and break down silos, across campus departments.</p>\n<p>I love attending WordCamps and other WordPress-related events, but the issues we generally encounter in higher ed are often overlooked.</p>\n<p>Much like online businesses or blogging, higher ed is a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. In our world, we don’t worry so much about which eCommerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with things like how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, making sure we’re abiding with FERPA regulations, or wondering how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’m proposing a new event in the WordPress community: a conference focused on using WordPress in the world of higher education. I call the idea “WordCampus”. (Kind of a perfect name, right? How did nobody think of this before?)</p>\n<p>The name “WordCampus” came to me from a tweet and does not, at this point, imply it would be an official WordCamp event. If needed, I’m open to organizing an event that is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. This is a detail that remains to be seen, but honestly, at this point, all details remain to be seen. A WordCamp representative has confirmed that a user group specific WordCamp is possible, but I would need to prove that it could draw a crowd. That’s why I need your help.</p>\n<p>If a WordPress conference for higher ed is something you would be interested in (whether it’s as an attendee, speaker, planner, sponsor, or all of the above), I invite you to read a few of my thoughts, share yours in the comments, and visit <a href=\"http://wordcampus.org/\">wordcampus.org</a> to show your support.</p>\n<h3>Cost and fee consideration</h3>\n<p>Much like your usual WordCamp, the goal for this event is to keep the costs and ticket price as low as possible. The point of this event is professional development and community, not profit. The phrases “big budget” and “higher ed” don’t generally appear in the same sentence anyway.</p>\n<p>A lot of higher ed-oriented web conferences can run upwards of $500 so an inexpensive, but valuable, event would be attractive for most higher education web professionals.</p>\n<h3>Unique sponsorship opportunity</h3>\n<p>Having sponsors to help with costs would be crucial and I am open to all kinds of support, whether it’s monetary or in-kind. Sponsoring an event like WordCampus would be a unique way to get an organization’s name in front of one of the best communities <em>outside</em> of WordPress that <em>uses</em> WordPress all the time.</p>\n<p>In the world of higher education, you often have limited resources, so there are plenty of opportunities for third party products or services like hosting, themes, plugins, custom design, accessibility consulting, and custom development, among others.</p>\n<h3>Location is a factor</h3>\n<p>The location could be a sticking point, as high travel costs might be a deal breaker for many WordCampus attendees. The beauty of local WordCamps is that they are tied to a geographical region and therefore, for most attendees, have limited travel requirements. This could be a problem for an event that is not tied to a specific region.</p>\n<p>Venue wise, universities have beautiful facilities, so I’d love to host the event on an actual college campus and, if the hosting university could donate the space in kind, this would be a huge cost saver. The most preferable universities would also be located near a major airport to help reduce travel time.</p>\n<p>If I’m really dreaming big, it would be great to find numerous universities that would be willing to host and, therefore, we could have regional WordCampus events spread across the country. I don’t think this is outside the realm of possibility, but would depend on interest and attendance. I&#8217;m certainly interested in hearing from anyone that may be interested in hosting WordCampus at their university.</p>\n<h3>A big target audience</h3>\n<p>There are a wide variety of WordPress users in higher ed, from the university-level WordPress developers and administrators, to the users who run WordPress for a college, to the faculty members using WordPress as a learning tool, and any students who’d love to learn a thing or two (they are our future, you know). That’s not even including content strategists, designers, social media managers, and more.</p>\n<p>WordCampus has the potential to attract a variety of users who could inspire a multitude of topics and professional development.</p>\n<h3>A broad variety of topics, even within the education umbrella</h3>\n<p>Speaking of topics, these could also run the gamut from higher ed marketing and content strategy to infrastructure, managing multi-author blogs, and streamlining application processes. Accessibility should also be a featured topic as federally funded institutions are required by law to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Personally, I see the structure of higher ed as tailor-made for the open source mindset and would love to hear someone encourage collaboration and openness by comparing the ideologies of open source with the inner workings of higher education.</p>\n<h3>Event timing</h3>\n<p>As organizing something of this magnitude takes time, I’m looking at a 2016 booking. What time of the year in 2016, however, remains to be seen. There are obviously a lot of variables at play, from venue availability to which time of the year is best for our target attendees. In higher ed, you need time to clear your schedule and request funding, so I’d want to allow for that.</p>\n<p>Usually, the middle of the semester is best for most higher ed professionals, but this can vary depending on their field. And if we’re being honest, the majority of fall might be out of the question because of football season. We’ve included a straw poll <a href=\"http://wordcampus.org\">on the event landing page</a> to help us gauge which time of year might be best for those interested in attending.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal and hopefully interested parties will have a few additional thoughts for the comments.

Я живу в Ростове-на-Дону, люблю своего пса Джека и пинаколаду. (И ещё попадать под дождь.)</blockquote>\r\n...или так:\r\n<blockquote>Компания «Штучки XYZ» была основана в 1971 году и с тех пор производит качественные штучки.
