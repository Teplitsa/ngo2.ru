You can even embed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/\">plugin</a> has been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/\">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162\">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/\">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

The guide explains how and where to provide feedback and how important it is to beta test new features.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve used WP Tavern to advocate for and against features in WordPress. One of the best pieces of advice I can give non-developers is to organize your thoughts or stance on a specific feature or direction and publish them on your site. This allows you to control the conversation and gives you plenty of space to explain your perspective.</p>\n<p>A great example <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress\">is this post</a> asking for help to add comment moderation approval notifications to WordPress. I explain why it&#8217;s needed with a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717\">link to the ticket</a> I created to keep track of the conversation. I prefer to write about potential features and based on feedback, I&#8217;ll either create a trac ticket myself or someone will do it for me with a link to the post.</p>\n<p>The Tavern is in the dashboard and is read by a large audience, including core developers. However, thanks to social media, a well constructed post with solid points will make the rounds on Twitter, Facebook, and within WordPress sub-communities.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s those posts and associated comments that serve as one of many foundations for change in WordPress without touching a line of code. Keep in mind that there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll be able to directly influence WordPress core development with words alone, but respectful, in-depth conversations with differing opinions and perspectives are an important part of the community regardless.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Nov 2015 08:42:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Daniel Bachhuber Raises More Than $17.5K to Develop a RESTful WP-CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48819\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/daniel-bachhuber-raises-more-than-17-5k-to-develop-a-restful-wp-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1664:\"<p><a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/\">Daniel Bachhuber</a>, who maintains <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI</a>, has successfully raised more than $21K through his <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielbachhuber/a-more-restful-wp-cli\">Kickstarter campaign</a>. He created the campaign to generate funding to develop a CLI interface for the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>According to Bachhuber, the project will allow WordPress REST API endpoints registered via plugins and themes to automatically be usable as WP-CLI commands. Developers will also be able to push and pull posts including, custom post types, users, and other WordPress REST API data between separate WordPress installations with a simple WP-CLI command.</p>\n<p>Bachhuber requested $17.5K and within twelve hours of publishing the campaign, he received more than the asking amount from 51 backers, including one who contributed $8,500. Bachhuber will donate one hour of time to the WordPress REST API project in 2016 for every $100 over the funding goal. Based on the current amount, that&#8217;s 46 hours.</p>\n<p>With funding in place, Bachhuber will work on the project throughout the first half of 2016, &#8220;$17,500 represents 150 hours of development at $100/hour, plus Kickstarter&#8217;s cut and costs associated with the rewards.

Here&#8217;s an example of what an oEmbedded post looks like.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Content is displayed in an iFrame with a link to comments, a sharing button, and a link to the main page the article is hosted on. The continue reading link takes visitors to the source site. In the last three months, Birchler and members of the core team have worked hard to make sure embedded content is secure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The iFrames use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Attributes\">sandbox attribute</a> to enable extra restrictions on content that can appear in the inline frame.</li>\n<li>The host and the embedded site communicate via postMessage to allow resizing and clicking on links safely</li>\n</ul>\n<p>oEmbed discovery is turned on by default in WordPress 4.4. Too disable it, you&#8217;ll need install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-embeds/\">Disable Embeds</a> plugin. The plugin does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents others from embedding your site.</li>\n<li>Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.</li>\n<li>Disables all JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/#comment-28263\">are requesting</a> that an option be added to disable oEmbeds rather than installing a plugin. In response to requests, Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, reemphasized <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#decisions\">WordPress&#8217; philosophy</a> on adding options.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every time you give a user an option, you are asking them to make a decision. When a user doesn’t care or understand the option this ultimately leads to frustration. As developers we sometimes feel that providing options for everything is a good thing, you can never have too many choices, right?</p>\n<p>Ultimately these choices end up being technical ones, choices that the average end-user has no interest in. It’s our duty as developers to make smart design decisions and avoid putting the weight of technical choices on our end users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Birchler also responded saying, &#8220;The new embed functionality was developed with the majority of users in mind.&#8221; One of the largest problems with adding to options to WordPress is that they&#8217;re difficult to remove.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress developers are excited to see how post embeds can be extended. <a href=\"http://hughlashbrooke.com/\">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who works for Automattic, thinks post embeds will be great for Custom Post Types, &#8220;I think the oEmbed feature has loads of awesome use cases for Custom Post Types. For example, being able to embed eCommerce products on other sites with dynamic add to cart links,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to try post embeds is to log into <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta\">TryWPBeta</a> using these credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create a new post and make sure the visual editor is selected.

Joe McGill, who is helping to merge the feature to core, joined me for a thirty minute interview to explain how it works.</p>\n<p>When users upload images in WordPress, it automatically crops new images to smaller sizes. For example, if you upload an image that&#8217;s 1500 x 706, the image sizes might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Size &#8211; 1500 x 706</li>\n<li>Large &#8211; 500 x 235</li>\n<li>Medium &#8211; 300 x 141</li>\n<li>Thumbnail &#8211; 150 x 150</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional sizes are created depending on the theme. If the full size image is attached to a post, users on desktop and mobile devices will see the full size image. However, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to use the full size image on mobile devices because of its display and file size.</p>\n<p>Responsive images in WordPress 4.4 adds <code>srcset</code>&nbsp;and <code>sizes</code> support to WordPress. This allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device&#8217;s screen size. If I attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress 4.4, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead.</p>\n<p>Responsive images don&#8217;t have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes.

According to download stats, Swift was downloaded between, 2,000 to 3,500 times a day in September and early October.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48767\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png?resize=665%2C500\" alt=\"Swift Download Count\" /></a>Swift Download Count\n<p>However, the stats drop off abruptly on October 15th and have yet to reach previous levels. On October 18th, a few members inside the Theme Review Team Slack channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445155458000095\">shared suspicions</a> that something was not right with Swift&#8217;s download stats.</p>\n<p>Ionut Neagu discovered that Swift does not appear on the <a href=\"https://garage.godaddy.com/top-100-wordpress-themes/\">GoDaddy Hot 100</a> while other themes on the popular page do. While not conclusive, the evidence points towards some sort of anomaly.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, who helps maintain WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445180169000105\">looked at the raw</a> data for Swift and discovered that a lot of the downloads appeared to be automated.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The swift theme is indeed getting an exceptional number of downloads, so I took a closer look at the raw data. It appears that a lot of these downloads are automated in some way. However, there&#8217;s no evidence that it is malicious, nor does the pattern apply only to the swift theme. Perhaps it is included in some installer system that auto-downloads themes for newly installed sites. It&#8217;s hard to say.</p>\n<p>In any case, I made a way to detect and block these types of automated downloads from appearing in the stats, and retroactively applied it for the last three days of data (which is all we retain). Going forward, automated downloads will not appear as downloads and will not affect the popular listings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once the changes were implemented, Swift&#8217;s download stats significantly decreased. The changes also apply to all other themes hosted on the directory. Otto declined to comment on the specific changes made but tells the Tavern, &#8220;If we can detect a case where downloads aren&#8217;t being made by users, then we will try not to count it in the results.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Swift’s Side of the Story</h2>\n<p>Satish Gandham, founder of <a href=\"https://swiftthemes.com/\">Swiftthemes</a>, explains what Swift has gone through the last few weeks which may account for the high download numbers, &#8220;Swift was featured for a couple of days and we spent money on Facebook ads to promote the free version. Also, there were a couple of hosted WordPress providers who asked permission to include Swift on their platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The premium version of Swift also had the same slug URL as the free version. The WordPress theme directory saw v7.2.48 to be higher than 7.2.6 and premium users downgraded to the free version thinking it was an upgrade. It was a support nightmare,&#8221; Gandham tells the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Swift&#8217;s <a href=\"https://swiftthemes.com/forums/topic/how-to-returning-to-version-7-2-6/\">support forums</a> confirm that some customers of the commercial version were automatically updated to the free version in early August.</p>\n<h2>Download Counts are Almost Irrelevant</h2>\n<p>When the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design\">plugin directory was redesigned</a> earlier this year, download counts were removed in favor of active installs. Active installs are more accurate and difficult to manipulate. On the other hand, when the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design\">theme directory was redesigned</a>, download counts remained.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that the theme directory will one day show active installs but the data gathering aspect is not ready yet. Also, the numbers are lower for themes than for plugins, which may lead to incorrect conclusions in regards to relative popularity.</p>\n<h2>It Happens More Than You Might Think</h2>\n<p>In this particular instance, there&#8217;s no evidence that points to a malicious intent to inflate stats to manipulate the popular themes page. In the years I&#8217;ve written about WordPress, I&#8217;ve heard rumors that certain plugins and themes automate their download counts to appear more popular than they really are. However, I&#8217;ve yet to write about a theme or plugin caught in the act.</p>\n<p>According to Otto, it happens more often than you might think. When he or other volunteer moderators for the plugin and theme directories notice fishy download counts, they contact the author and the process usually stops. If it continues, the author risks having their themes and plugins suspended or banned from the directory.</p>\n<p>If you notice suspicious activity with a theme hosted on WordPress.org, you can voice your concern in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Theme Review Slack</a> channel during non-meeting times. For suspicious activity related to plugins hosted on the directory, email <strong>plugins at WordPress.org</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 20:23:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Post Status: Using WordPress as an application framework — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://poststatus.com/using-wordpress-as-an-application-framework-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2324:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Actions performed in one dashboard are mirrored to the other. Users can switch between the two with the click of a button.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48757\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif?resize=638%2C512\" alt=\"ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion\" /></a>ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion\n<p>Users can now sort sites by tags and clients in addition to groups. Websites can be assigned to clients while tags can describe whether a site is in development or live. Each site can up to five tags and one client.</p>\n<p>Unlike the native dashboard, Orion uses Angular.js which allows users to run asynchronous calls. For example, you can run more than one command why performing other tasks.</p>\n<p>One distinct difference between both dashboards is the way backups are generated. ManageWP backups and Orion backups are <a href=\"https://managewp.com/managewp-orion-developer-diary-3-bulletproof-backup-solution\">completely different</a> from each other. However, you can use both at the same time.</p>\n<p>The company says Orion comes with essential features but additional features will be completed and added by February of 2016 which is also when Orion will become the default dashboard. WordPress Multisite is not supported as the company cites it as a major undertaking and doesn&#8217;t consider it a high priority.</p>\n<p>The new dashboard contains more features than what&#8217;s listed here. I encourage you to read the <a href=\"https://managewp.com/developer-diary-9-managewp-orion-is-out\">official announcement</a> and if you&#8217;re a customer, to explore Orion as it will soon be the default experience to managing sites.

He mostly uses WordPress for personal projects although he has completed a couple of projects for others. In addition to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kidsguide/\">maintaining a few plugins</a>, he&#8217;s an active translations contributor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Automatic translations for plugins have been a long time coming. WordPress itself already auto-downloads and auto-updates core translations, so it is a natural progression that plugins and themes will receive the same treatment.</p>\n<p>For those who have been following auto plugin translations, it has <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/\">been in the works for years</a>. It came as a welcome surprise in September when it was announced that plugins will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/09/01/plugin-translations-on-wordpress-org/\">finally be able to have language packs</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a plugin in the WordPress.org directory, then this is important, welcome, and exciting news. However, as great as an initiative as language packs are for plugins, it <em>seems</em> simpler than it actually is.</p>\n<p>If you are a plugin developer, you have to go through a few steps in order to get this to work for your plugins. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Should You Be Excited About Plugin Language Packs?</h2>\n<p>As a plugin author, I&#8217;m really excited about the new translation system, and so should you. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a> is making it so that you no longer have to include all of your <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files directly in your plugin. Instead, they will be hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48731\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png?resize=582%2C575\" alt=\"screenshot-1\" /></a>The ideal scenario is when a user selects their language (either through a new WordPress install or through <code>Settings &gt; General</code>), the language pack for your plugin will be automatically installed and kept updated.</p>\n<p>This new system accomplishes a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin files are smaller. There&#8217;s no need to include translation files with your plugin.</li>\n<li>Plugin authors no longer need to manage translations/translators.</li>\n<li>End users are automatically able to see a plugin in their own language assuming a translation has already been created for their locale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">How to Prepare for Plugin Language Packs</h2>\n<p>Before we jump into translating plugins, you first need to prepare your plugin for it to work with the new translation setup.</p>\n<p>In order for you to get your plugin prepared to be moved over to the new system, you need to change your text domain to exactly match your WordPress plugin slug. An important reminder is that even if you have changed your plugin&#8217;s name (as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\">Yoast SEO</a> recently did), the slug does not change. For a more in-depth discussion and tutorial, please follow Otto&#8217;s great post on <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/\">language pack prepwork</a>.</p>\n<p>You are still welcome to include translation files in your plugin, even with language packs enabled. Translation files in your plugin take priority, and if those aren&#8217;t present, that&#8217;s where language packs come in.</p>\n<p>When you are preparing your plugin for language packs, it is important to note that you should avoid removing translation files from your plugin. If you do so, and your plugin is selected for language packs, your existing translations will not be automatically moved over to the new system.</p>\n<p>Do your best to keep your translation files with your plugin until the Polyglots team has informed you that your plugin is ready for language packs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Wait to Receive the Official Notice</h2>\n<p>The Polyglot team is preparing the plugins in stages to avoid any major hiccups. Assuming your WordPress.org email is up-to-date, you will receive an email when your plugin is ready.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering how long it takes before the team reaches your plugin. There are 40,000+ plugins on WordPress.org, so it is not a quick process. WordPress is preparing plugins in batches according to the amount of active installs each plugin has.</p>\n<p>If your plugin has over 30,000+ active installs, then chances are you are on the new system, although I&#8217;ve seen plugins with 10,000+ active installs also be approved.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to make the process quicker. Please practice patience and eventually your turn will come.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">You’ve Received the E-Mail That Your Plugin Is Ready</h2>\n<p>So you finally receive the email saying that your plugin is going to be uploaded with language pack support. Awesome! This is what the email that I received looks like. Note that I&#8217;m using one of my approved plugins as an example.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Howdy!<br />\n​<br />\nWe&#8217;re emailing you because you&#8217;re an author for the following plugin on WordPress.org:<br />\n​<br />\n* Easy Updates Manager : https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/<br />\n​<br />\nNext week, we intend to import the plugin listed above into the translate.wordpress.org translation system. Language packs will also be enabled for your plugin, for any locales that are fully translated (at 100%).<br />\n​<br />\nAs part of this process, all of the strings in your plugin will be imported into translate.wordpress.org. Additionally, any language files that you ship with your plugin (&#8216;mo&#8217; files) will be imported and synced with their respective locales within translate.wordpress.org.<br />\n​<br />\nNo strings in your plugin? Plugin translations include the ability to translate the readme and display these translations in the localized WordPress.org plugin directories.</p>\n<p>If you have prepared your plugin already then this notice is of no real importance. If you have not yet prepared your plugin and you have received the notice then you need to prepare your plugin ASAP. If you don’t prepare your plugin then… well… I don’t really know, but it won’t be good. So go and prepare your plugin if you have not yet done so.<br />\n&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Your Plugin Is Semi-Ready for Language Packs. Now What?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-48741 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png?resize=291%2C321\" alt=\"screenshot-22\" /></a>A week or so after you receive the notice, your plugin and its translations are moved to <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org\">translate.wordpress.org</a>. You will likely not receive a notice when your plugin is moved.</p>\n<p>To find out if it&#8217;s been uploaded, visit your plugin&#8217;s WordPress.org page where you should see a translations section in the right sidebar. Click the <strong>Translate Plugin Name </strong>button<strong>.</strong> If you are brought to a page that looks like the one below then your plugin is uploaded and is ready to be translated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48734\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png?resize=954%2C611\" alt=\"screenshot-3\" /></a>If you see a page that looks different from this (i.e., a Not Found error), your plugin is not yet ready.</p>\n<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve received the e-mail, your plugin is ready, and you&#8217;ve waited a reasonable amount of time, you should be good to go as far as preparing your plugin.</p>\n<p>If it has been over two weeks and your plugin has not yet been uploaded, you should contact the Polyglot team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">on their blog</a>, or in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">#polyglots channel on WordPress Slack</a>. Please exercise extreme patience as the process can take a week or sometimes even two.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Removing Your Translation Files From Your Plugin</h2>\n<p>Now that your plugin is uploaded to the system, you can safely remove the translation files from your plugin. If you don’t have any <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files in your plugin, then you can skip this step.</p>\n<p>One thing to note: You may not want to remove your translation files if your plugin does not have any translations on <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">translate.wordpress.org</a> or translations are not 100% complete.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Making Your Plugin Translatable</h2>\n<p>With all of that stuff out-of-the-way, it’s time to focus on translating your plugin. This is where it can get confusing but try to stick with me.</p>\n<p>By default, you cannot submit translations for your plugin in any language. Because of this, you need to ask the Polyglots team to add you as a translator for your plugin. You can do so by heading over to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots blog</a> and ask them. To make it easier they came up with a template of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/theme-plugin-directories/#sample-post\">what to say</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello Polyglots!</p>\n<p>I am the plugin author for [plugin-name and link to plugin directory]. We have a number of great translation editors that we’d like to be able to approve translation for our plugin(s). Please add the following WordPress.org users as translation editors for their respective locales:<br />\no #ar – @username<br />\no #bn – @username, @username<br />\no #da – @username<br />\no #de-ch – @username<br />\netc…</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, just comment here. Thank you!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, the above will include requests for multiple plugins, but as plugins are being rolled out slowly, it&#8217;s acceptable at the moment to include one request per plugin.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you use WordPress.org usernames and that the user is still active. If you are wondering what languages there are, you can visit <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a> and scroll through the different languages that WordPress supports.</p>\n<p>Please only ask to be added as a translator for the languages you know. You will not be approved if you are not a native speaker for a language.</p>\n<p>At this point, again, patience is needed. The Polyglot team will receive your request and will work through it. If your post doesn&#8217;t show up right away, it&#8217;s because first-time posters are moderated.</p>\n<p>In a week or two, the translators you requested should be added to your plugin. If there are any issues, a Polyglot member will comment on your request with any difficulties encountered or notify you that they have approved your request.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when you are added when you see new badges appear on your WordPress.org profile page. One is a translation editor badge and the other is a translation contributor badge.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48735\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png?resize=601%2C322\" alt=\"screenshot-4\" /></a>How Do I Translate?</h2>\n<p>First, visit <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a>, select your language, then click the plugins tab. Search for your plugin and then click the translate project button. You&#8217;ll be brought to a page that looks like the one below. This page is where you can translate your plugin. In this case, my plugin is already translated in the language that I selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48736\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png?resize=957%2C587\" alt=\"screenshot-5\" /></a>On this table, there are four separate things to translate. Trunk, the stable release (version), and the <code>readme.txt</code> variations. In order for language packs to work, <em>you need to translate all four versions</em>.</p>\n<p>To translate, click on one of the sub-projects. This takes you to the translation page. Here, you can see all of the different strings that need to be translated in your plugin. You can edit a string by clicking the details button, translating it in the text editor, and then clicking the <strong>add translations</strong> button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48737\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png?resize=947%2C561\" alt=\"screenshot-6\" /></a>Even if you&#8217;re not added as an editor for a language, you can still translate a plugin. The only difference is instead of adding the translations directly, you can only request that it be changed. Someone from the Polyglots team will need review and approve your translation suggestions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Once Your Translations Are Ready</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished translating a language completely, it will be available for people to use. However, it doesn’t become available immediately. It can take one to three days for a translation to be available once you finish it. Again, exercise patience.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when the translation is available when you see it in the translation section on your WordPress.org plugin&#8217;s page. For example, you can see what it looks like in the picture below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48744\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png?resize=447%2C377\" alt=\"screenshot-7\" /></a>Also, you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s working if you go into a website (preferably not a live website), download your plugin, and select the language that you want to test in <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Plugin Language Packs Are Here to Stay</h2>\n<p>Getting language packs to work properly in WordPress plugins is not exactly a straightforward process, which is precisely why plugins are being rolled out slowly.</p>\n<p>Please remember that everyone is a volunteer, from the Polyglots team, to translators, and to the plugin authors. Please give props where appropriate as everyone is working hard to make plugin language packs the norm.</p>\n<p>If you are having any trouble, the Polyglots team also has a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/\">handbook</a> available which provides some good information on how this new system works.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also do my best to answer any questions in the comment section. If you have additional insight, please weigh in as well.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 02:52:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: Test New WordPress Features Without Installing Anything via TryWPBeta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48713\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3568:\"<p>Over the weekend at <a href=\"https://portland.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Portland, Oregon</a>, Drew Jaynes, a WordPress core developer who also led the 4.2 development cycle presented on the topic of beta testing WordPress.</p>\n<p>In the presentation, Jaynes highlights the pros and cons of using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Testing plugin</a> on a testing site and a production site. However, he also cites a third way to test WordPress via <a href=\"http://wcpdx.trywpbeta.com/\">TryWPBeta.com</a>.</p>\n<p> \n<div> <strong> <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture/trying-out-tomorrows-wordpress-today\" title=\"Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today\" target=\"_blank\">Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture\" target=\"_blank\">DrewAPicture</a></strong> </div>\n<p>TryWPBeta is a locked down, vanilla install of WordPress trunk using Multisite. To login to the site, use the following credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Jaynes what inspired him to create the site, &#8220;The inspiration for TryWPBeta is to actually have a place for core contributors to test patches on mobile devices, because setting up a tunnel to a local development setup is difficult and a high barrier for a lot of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is to make it possible to spin up a site using trunk (Bleeding edge version of WordPress), apply a specific patch and then freeze it in time so that we can point people there to test on mobile devices,&#8221; Jaynes told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>While you can&#8217;t install themes and plugins yet, the site gives users an opportunity to test new features without worrying about breaking the site. Thanks to TryWPBeta, I was able to test the new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34903\">Post oEmbed feature</a> in 4.4.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48714\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png?resize=1025%2C458\" alt=\"Testing oEmbeds of Posts\" /></a>Testing oEmbeds of Posts\n<p>Jaynes started the project at 10up&#8217;s company summit. So far, Scott Reilly, John Blackbourn, Zach Brown, Morgan Estes, and Chris Weigman have contributed to the project. The site is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet and updates hourly. He stresses that the site is a work in progress and not quite ready for prime time, &#8220;There’s a couple features I’d like to add to make it more robust first,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://demo.joomla.org/\">Joomla</a>, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated demo site for users to test drive the software. While I like the idea behind TryWPBeta, there are a few things I&#8217;d like to see added to make it more useful. For instance, a list of items to test that users can check off. Also, an easy way to provide feedback on the listed items that is sent to a place where core developers will read it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to see the WordPress Beta Testing plugin extended to have the features I mentioned above. Between the communication challenges and setting up the environment, the beta testing process in WordPress is not as easy and streamlined as it could be. What ideas do you have that would help increase the testing audience and make the process easier?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:37:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: VersionPress Raises $400K in Seed Funding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48709\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-raises-400k-in-seed-funding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2780:\"<p><a href=\"http://versionpress.net/\">VersionPress</a>, a version control plugin for WordPress, has <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/seed-funding/\">raised $400K in seed funding</a> from five investors, led by <a href=\"http://www.credoventures.com/\">Credo Ventures</a> based in Prague. In July of 2014, VersionPress conducted a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise $30K. However, the team raised only <strong>45% of the $30,000</strong> funding goal.</p>\n<p>The team pressed on and released the first version back in January. Since then, the team has relied on funding from the <a href=\"http://versionpress.net/\">Early Access Program</a>. Borek Bernard, the lead developer of VersionPress, says the influx of cash will help fuel rapid development:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First and foremost, it means that we will be able to develop VersionPress at a more rapid pace. What we currently have in the <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/\">recently released v2.0</a> is a great start but the vision and the technical challenge are just so large that this new fuel will is more than welcome. We have many cool features planned and this will allow us to deliver them in a timely manner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The funding comes on the heels of <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/\">VersionPress 2.0</a> which includes, database synchronization functionality and an updated user interface that is completely JavaScript based, along with a number of other features. In addition to funding, Bernard says talking to investors gives him a fresh perspective on the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One big benefit of talking to investors is that it provides a fresh perspective on the problems one is trying to solve, how to solve them, for whom, etc. Speaking to them made us realize a couple of important things which will greatly benefit our users down the road.</p></blockquote>\n<p>VersionPress joins a growing list of WordPress products and services that have raised venture capital.

Although Vimal is participating in the commercial plugin space by selling a <a href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/slack/\">Slack add-on for Ninja Forms</a>, this acquisition marks the first plugin sold directly from his site.</p>\n<p>With the acquisition, <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/nikhil-vimal-adopts-front-end-registration-and-login-forms-plugin/\">Williamson notes</a> that existing customers will no longer be able to renew license keys on <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com\">Pippinsplugins.com</a>. A complete customer list was given to Vimal and Williamson is no long providing support.</p>\n<p>When the opportunity presented itself to adopt a plugin created by Williamson, Vimal jumped on it, &#8220;Shortly after I saw his tweet, I quickly contacted Pippin. His work is something I’ve always looked up to. His work on plugins has inspired me to pursue the plugin/product market,&#8221; Vimal said.</p>\n<p>Licenses start at $10 for single sites, $20 for two to five sites, and $35 for an unlimited number of sites. Vimal says that he is working on a new version with changes in design, functionality, and more. The plugin will also receive its own dedicated site with a change in branding.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see what changes Vimal has in store for the plugin. Until then, existing customers from Pippinsplugins.com should watch their inbox for details on renewing their subscription to TechVoltz.com.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 20:02:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 Beta 1 Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48687\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-beta-1-released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4051:\"<p>After more than eight weeks in development, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/10/wordpress-4-4-beta-1/\">WordPress 4.4. beta 1 is available</a> for testing.

As a rule of thumb, think of commits as an incremental improvement to WordPress core.</p>\n<p>There are three new distinct user facing features in WordPress 4.4.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Twenty Sixteen</strong> &#8211; Twenty Sixteen is a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme\">new default theme</a> with a simple layout and color scheme designed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi\">Takashi Irie,</a> who also designed the <a href=\"http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/\">Twenty Fourteen</a> and <a href=\"http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/\">Twenty Fifteen</a> default themes.</li>\n<li><strong>Responsive Images</strong> &#8211; WordPress will automatically deliver a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/responsive-images-merge-proposal/\">more appropriate image</a> to users depending on a variety of conditions like screen size, view port size, and screen resolution.</li>\n<li><strong>oEmbed Posts</strong> &#8211; In addition to YouTube, WordCamp.TV and other whitelisted providers, users will be able to easily embed content from almost any site that supports the <a href=\"http://oembed.com/\">oEmbed standard</a>, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">WordPress sites</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scott Taylor, who is leading the 4.4 development cycle, gives developers at least four reasons to be excited.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/\">plugin</a> is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/\">included in WordPress 4.4</a>. Plugin authors can take advantage of this by adding custom endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>Term Metadata </strong>— Taxonomy term metadata <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/04/taxonomy-term-metadata-proposal/\">is included</a> in WordPress 4.4. Developers who are using a plugin to implement term metadata should <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/\">read this post</a> on how to prepare for the switch. Also, the underlying <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/\">WP_Term class</a> improves caching when working with terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is deprecated; WordPress will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/\">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Comment</code> class improves caching and introduces strong-typing.

With <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/35294\">the change</a>, plugin authors will be able to check for theme support and use a few new filters to manipulate the title. The new filters are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>\'pre_get_document_title\'</code> short-circuits <code>wp_get_document_title()</code> if it returns anything other than an empty value.</li>\n<li><code>\'document_title_separator\'</code> filters the separator between title parts.</li>\n<li><code>\'document_title_parts\'</code> filters the parts that make up the document title, passed in an associative array.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theme authors should no longer use <code>wp_title()</code> to generate document titles. If theme authors add <code>add_theme_support( ‘title-tag’ );</code> to the <code>after_setup_theme</code> callback, the title will be handled natively via an internal WordPress core function.

In the announcement, we recommended that other WordPress users across the globe urgently consider blocking the technology on their own web servers as well.</p>\n<h2>XML-RPC in WordPress Has a Troubled Past</h2>\n<p>Days after the announcement<em>,</em> Daniel Cid, founder and CTO of Sucuri, and Mark Maunder, CEO of WordFence, <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> the <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2015/10/wordpress-xml-rpc-brute-force-attacks-amplification-multiple-logins/\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that a new type of Brute Force login attack was being carried out on a massive scale against WordPress sites around the world using XML-RPC. Apparently, hackers have wised up to the fact that <code>wp-login.php</code> is often well protected.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more shocking than this latest wave of attacks is that <em>they are nothing new,</em> as Sucuri previously <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/new-brute-force-attacks-exploiting-xmlrpc-in-wordpress.html\">reported a similar wave of attacks</a> in July 2014. Let&#8217;s also not forget the wide-scale use of XML-RPC to perform <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html\">DDoS attacks</a> on WordPress websites <a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/blog/wordpress-security-alert-pingback-ddos.html\">reported by Incapsula</a> in 2013. Combine these reports with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awordpress.org%2Fsupport%2F+xml-rpc+attack\">hundreds of posts</a> on the wordpress.org support forums and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Astackoverflow.com+xml-rpc+attack\">Stack Overflow</a> and a picture is painted of years of unhindered attacks against millions of WordPress sites due to this single PHP file, yikes!</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. ― Franklin D. Roosevelt</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be the one to advocate that XML-RPC be removed from WordPress but that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing: <strong>It&#8217;s time for WordPress XML-RPC to hit the road, for good.</strong></p>\n<h2>XML-RPC Was a Conscious Mistake</h2>\n<p>I understand that thousands of volunteer hours have been invested into XML-RPC support for the WordPress platform, as is the nature of open-source communities. I sincerely respect and thank said programmers and volunteers for creating a very cool way to remotely connect to a website built on WordPress. But sometimes, we need to be honest with ourselves and admit when something isn&#8217;t working; <em>This one of those times.</em></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I&#8217;m framing the XML-RPC mess as a conscious mistake, <strong>that&#8217;s because it was</strong>. Three years ago, Andrew Nacin, a WordPress core developer, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21509\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> in a trac ticket that, <em>&#8220;Security is no greater a concern than the rest of core. There is no longer a compelling reason to disable [XML-RPC] by default. It’s time we should remove the option entirely.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Three years later, millions of WordPress sites have been hacked, crashed, or attacked, due to XML-RPC. It’s undeniable that removing the option to disable it (and/or enabling it by default) was wrong.</p>\n<h2>Out of Touch With the Average User</h2>\n<p>When broken down, it&#8217;s a classic case of extremely talented and intelligent software developers being out of touch with the millions of <strong>average Joes</strong> that use WordPress and have no idea what XML-RPC is. When developers inevitably argue that there are several free security plugins available that can help combat XML-RPC attacks, they completely miss the point: <u>the majority of webmasters being attacked are the same ones who don&#8217;t even know what a security plugin is or how to use it</u>.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the one good <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bruteprotect/\" target=\"_blank\">standalone plugin</a> that fought Brute Force login attempts was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect\" target=\"_blank\">foolishly</a> <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-protect-blocks-brute-force-amplification-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">combined</a> into the controversial Jetpack plugin, which most serious webmasters would never consider installing.</p>\n<p>The premise, of course, for XML-RPC support in WordPress is a noble idea that sounds versatile: it allows, as previously mentioned, remote connections (logins, usually) to any given domain that is running a WordPress installation. In reality, however, this XML-RPC functionality is primarily used for three common reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pingbacks/trackbacks (great for Viagra spam, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death\" target=\"_blank\">DDoS attacks</a>, and not much else)</li>\n<li>Jetpack (an all-in-one solution to <a href=\"http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">slowing down</a> and/or bloating your WordPress site with third-party scripts)</li>\n<li>WP mobile apps (I&#8217;m not sure who blogs from their smart phone, but the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yo./id834335592\" target=\"_blank\">YO app</a> is literally rated higher than <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/wordpress/id335703880\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> on the iTunes store, and the user reviews of the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> version repeatedly point to XML-RPC login issues)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do recall that the WordPress backend is now responsive, which means you can login to your blog from practically any mobile device; this wasn’t the case when the native WordPress mobile apps were first launched. And arguably, the vast majority of WordPress sites have absolutely no use for pingbacks, trackbacks, or XML-RPC in general.</p>\n<h2>XML-RPC Needs to Be Disabled or Removed From WordPress</h2>\n<p><u>The logical conclusion should be immediately clear:</u> XML-RPC needs to die a quick death in the WordPress community, or at least be shifted into an optional (non-default) plugin or otherwise, in order to bring an immediate and measurable improvement to the security and stability of not only WordPress sites, but the internet overall.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Jeff Chandler <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">said it best</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WP Tavern is no stranger to denial of service attacks due to pingbacks and trackbacks. In 2010, I explained how WP Tavern was trackbacked to death. Shortly after the website came back online, I disabled both as I feared they might end up taking the site down again. A few years have gone by and I’ve re-enabled pingbacks and trackbacks with no ill effects. However, I wonder if it’s time to kill them once and for all, not just on WP Tavern but in WordPress in general.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes, we as developers and others with a technical mindset get caught up in solving the challenge of the day, when what is really needed is to step back and take a more philosophical look at the bigger picture. Is this thing worth our time, or is it causing more problems than solutions? When it comes to XML-RPC in WordPress, the conclusion is obvious.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 21:33:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Post Status: Playing with type\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14750\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://poststatus.com/playing-with-type/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8443:\"<p>I am far from a typography expert, but I do love playing with type. I delight in a great reading experience, and I strongly believe typography is the key to creating a great reading experience.</p>\n<p>In my own journeys searching for and choosing typefaces for my projects, I&#8217;ve discovered some great tools, and also some pitfalls of using different delivery services.</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"http://typography.com\">Typography.com</a> and <a href=\"http://typekit.com\">Typekit</a> accounts, and of course using <a href=\"http://google.com/fonts\">Google Fonts</a> is very simple. Many folks also use <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/\">Myfonts</a>, generate their own on <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/\">Fontsquirrel</a>, self-host direct from foundries, or use a variety of other methods.</p>\n<p>When you use a font delivery service, where the font is hosted elsewhere, and you simply connect (like Typekit or Typography.com), one of the things you deal with is the authentication of your site with the service that can often cause sad delays in pageload times. Zach Tollman did a great post discussing how <a href=\"https://www.tollmanz.com/typography-coms-cssom-blocking-font-loader/\">Typography.com in particular is not good at handling this authentication</a>, from a performance perspective.</p>\n<p>Given that I host Post Status fonts on Typography.com &#8212; I use Gotham Round, Gotham Condensed, and Sentinel here, and none of them are available anywhere else &#8212; the hit on performance perturbs me. However, I love these fonts and hate to replace them. However, I&#8217;ve lately been doing some research so I can at least test font stacks from Typekit and Google to see how big of an impact it could have.</p>\n<h3>Finding Typefaces</h3>\n<p>Finding quality typefaces is a challenge. There are <em>so many</em> out there, and the differences in quality can be vast. Part of what I love about Typography.com is that the quality of the display and cross-browser rendering is outstanding. Typekit serves typefaces from a variety of foundries, but they too have built great tools over the years to try and ensure quality rendering. Google is more of a mixed bag, though open source typefaces are getting more attention to detail in recent years than ever before.</p>\n<p>By far, my favorite tool for browsing and finding typefaces is <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com\">Typewolf</a>. Typewolf has PDF guides (free with your email), trending typefaces, sites of the day, and high quality recommendations on when and where to use a particular typeface. A sample resource that&#8217;s outstanding is their list of the <a href=\"https://www.typewolf.com/open-source-web-fonts\">top 30 open source Google fonts</a>. They have many others like that. It&#8217;s definitely a must-visit site when you are considering changing up your site typography.</p>\n<p>You can also browse delivery services directly. Typekit&#8217;s <a href=\"https://typekit.com/lists\">lists</a> are pretty good for narrowing typefaces by their intended purpose. <a href=\"http://justmytype.co/\">Justmytype</a> is another great resource that shows recommended pairings for fonts from Typekit and Typography.com. And of course Google has filters in their directory to help narrow it down, but it&#8217;s still a bit of the wild west, so I usually rely on Googling good pairings for Google.</p>\n<h3>Tinkering with typefaces with real content</h3>\n<p>Once you find some Typefaces you like, then it&#8217;s fun to put them into practice. <a href=\"http://typecast.com/\">Typecast</a> is excellent. You can find fonts from many foundries with a free account, and do all sorts of manipulations to see the typefaces in action, using a variety of font combinations, before you move to your actual site.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14749\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/typecast-view-752x462.png\" alt=\"typecast-view\" width=\"752\" height=\"462\" /></p>\n<p>Beware, it&#8217;s easy to spend hours in this tool. I love that you can edit the CSS directly, and there are also tools within Typecast to insert particular types of content, so you can have a working prototype pretty quickly.</p>\n<h3>Performance implications</h3>\n<p>Loading fonts is a huge performance issue sometimes. Too many fonts, content blocking loading, time-outs from third party delivery services, and other gotchas can severely impact a site&#8217;s load times.</p>\n<p>Anytime you are looking at new typefaces to use, consider where you can serve them from, whether you can self host them, how the delivery authenticates, and potentially more &#8212; before you get your heart set.</p>\n<p>Some good rules of thumb are this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google is by far the fastest, but you just don&#8217;t have access to some of the greatest font foundries this way, because all Google fonts are free.</li>\n<li>Self hosting is probably similar to or faster than serving them from Google. Most Google fonts are locally cached on lots of folks computers. Self hosting may be better for a more rare font, but for common fonts, Google may actually be faster.</li>\n<li>System fonts are always the fastest, but you might not be able to deliver your preferred typeface if the system the reader is using doesn&#8217;t support the typeface. If using system typefaces, creating thorough font stacks is a necessity. Sometimes, especially for sans-serifs, I&#8217;m tempted to just declare sans-serif, so that the system serves its favorite font &#8212; as Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, et al each have their own defaults. For serifs, I&#8217;d say just use Georgia if using system fonts only <img src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li>\n<li>Typekit and Myfonts and other delivery services are usually similar in quality, but it&#8217;s one of the slowest options for delivery. Be sure to only use the weights and versions you need, and considering limiting character sets if you can get away with it.</li>\n<li>Have a performance budget for your type. Sometimes you have to make hard choices. Does your body font really need to be a non-system font? What if you just used a single display font to add the character you seek? Can you get away without italics for a certain typeface you&#8217;re using? What about bold? If you use the regular/bold/italic/bold-italic for every typeface, that adds up quickly. Use the bare minimum and add whenever you need to only.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t get too fancy, and consider your tone</h3>\n<p>My biggest mistakes over the years playing with type have been getting too fancy, especially with body copy. Simple is good with type. Especially when choosing body copy, be sure to learn about the typeface you like &#8212; and don&#8217;t just trust your own eye early on &#8212; to see if it&#8217;s an appropriate workhorse typeface.</p>\n<p>With display type, you have more leeway, but consider the mood that the typeface sets. Slabs, serifs, gothic, humanist, and other styles of type each tend to have their own tone that they set. For instance, when you read the New York Times, Georgia is a serious workhorse font, and the custom display font also sets a sober tone. Compared to Vox, for example, which uses a more casual sans-serif body copy and quite decorative display typeface. In both scenarios, readability is very good, but they set a different tone.</p>\n<h3>Learning typography takes time</h3>\n<p>Learning and understanding good typography practices takes time. Many factors are at play to make a typeface look great, and even the greatest typefaces can get screwed up when not used well.</p>\n<p>Learning best practices for things like line length, line height, pairing, and much much more can probably get you farther than what typeface you choose. And different typefaces obviously do better in different settings. The key is to take it slow, learn what you like when you are reading other websites, and see what they are doing that you are not. Also, ask your friends about your choices and get feedback; sometimes just a minor change can make a big difference, and suddenly your design clicks.</p>\n<p>We can easily be blind to our own typography mistakes.

According <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/security-advisory-stored-xss-in-akismet-wordpress-plugin.html\">to Sucuri</a>, sites using Akismet 3.1.4 and lower and that have the <strong><em>Convert emoticons like <img class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" /> and <img src=\"http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f61b.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> to graphics on display</em></strong> option enabled, are at risk.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability stems from the way Akismet handles hyperlinks within a site&#8217;s comments.

I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not outlawed in an office to get out of your chair and do 20 jumping jacks, or plank for a minute, I definitely would feel awkward doing so. This is something on my mind as I&#8217;m working this week around ~400 colleagues for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/a8cgm\">our once-a-year Grand Meetup</a>.</p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m home and have a ton of work to get through, my favorite approach is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">Pomodoro Technique</a> with 25 minutes on followed by a 5 minute break. (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12\">I use this app</a> but any timer will do.) The 5 minute break is a fantastic time to do something small, like a few push-ups, squats, a plank, or even meditate. (The new <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pause-relaxation-at-your-fingertip/id991764216?mt=8\">Pause app is cool</a>, and of course I <a href=\"http://calm.com/\">love Calm</a>.) You don&#8217;t have to do a ton, but over the course of a day or a week these 5 minute break exercises add up to be quite a bit and can <a href=\"http://tinyhabits.com/\">kickstart a Tiny Habit</a>. And don&#8217;t even get me started on the benefits of naps.</p>\n<p>Again, not something that&#8217;s impossible in an shared office, just feels a lot more natural and less embarrassing in your private home office.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 18:37:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Akismet: Akismet 3.1.5: Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1877\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://blog.akismet.com/2015/10/13/akismet-3-1-5-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1660:\"<p><b>Version 3.1.5 of the Akismet plugin for WordPress contains a critical security fix.

Sucuri <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/10/brute-force-amplification-attacks-against-wordpress-xmlrpc.html\">is reporting</a> that brute force amplification attacks are targeting WordPress sites with XML-RPC enabled. In a nutshell, XML-RPC contains a system.multicall method which allows developers to execute multiple methods and commands inside a single request.</p>\n<h2>What is a Brute Force Amplification Attack?</h2>\n<p>In a typical brute force attack, several machines or bots try to guess the username and password for a site one  at a time. In a brute force amplification attack, attackers can guess hundreds or thousands of combinations within a single request making the attack more efficient and difficult to block.</p>\n<p>The XML-RPC protocol in WordPress is a communications bridge between remote applications such as the WordPress mobile apps and the site itself. It&#8217;s also used to communicate and authenticate to Jetpack.</p>\n<h2>Jetpack Protect Does Its Job</h2>\n<p>Jetpack comes with a module called <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/security-features/\">Jetpack Protect</a> formerly <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect\">known as BruteProtect</a>, that protects sites from brute force attacks. Sam Hotchkiss, lead developer of Jetpack Protect, <a href=\"https://samhotchkiss.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/testing-for-xml-rpc-multicall-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress/\">confirms in a blog post</a> that Jetpack Protect blocks brute force amplification attacks out-of-the box.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In our testing, we confirmed that Jetpack Protect (and BruteProtect) do block this attack vector.  If you’re running Jetpack with Protect enabled or you’re running BruteProtect, you don’t need to do anything to keep yourself safe from this attack technique.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you use Jetpack Protect, you don&#8217;t need to do anything to block this attack vector. For everyone else, Sucuri recommends that administrators block system.multicall requests as they&#8217;re not used much in the wild. There&#8217;s also a handful of security plugins such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/\">iThemes Security</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/\">WordPress Simple Firewall</a> that block system.multicalls and can disable XML-RPC.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 18:24:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: What Do You Want to See in a WordPress.tv Redesign?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48595\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://wptavern.com/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-a-wordpress-tv-redesign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1693:\"<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a> team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv/2015/10/08/building-a-better-wordpress-tv-functional-requirements/\">requesting feedback</a> on what features you&#8217;d like to see in a website redesign.

I&#8217;d also like to see this feature and have the videos saved to my WordPress.org profile. I&#8217;ve noticed that a lot of links to presentation slides point to the speaker&#8217;s personal site. To protect against link rot and expiring domains, WordPress.tv or a sister site should host presentation slides.</p>\n<p>On the single post view for videos, you have to scroll down to read a video&#8217;s description in the right hand sidebar.

Many of the comments don&#8217;t link to or provide data that backs up their claim.</p>\n<p>Outside of the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/benchmarks-indicate-jetpack-doesnt-negatively-impact-site-loading-times\">benchmarks</a> produced by the BruteProtect team late last year, there&#8217;s little evidence to support the claim that Jetpack negatively impacts a site&#8217;s performance. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/#content-plugins\">Arūnas Liuiza</a>, a WordPress plugin developer, is working <a href=\"http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/\">on a new project</a> that hopes to solve the mystery of whether or not Jetpack causes sites to load more slowly.</p>\n<h2>Preparing the Testing Environment</h2>\n<p>In the next few weeks, Liuiza and his students will scour the WordPress plugin directory to find plugins with comparable features to Jetpack&#8217;s modules. The team is going to set up three identical WordPress sites with default Lorem Ipsum content.</p>\n<p>One site will act as the benchmark, another will run Jetpack, and the third will run plugins similar to Jetpack&#8217;s modules. Liuiza explains how his students will perform the benchmark process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ll start the measuring, with different plugins/modules activated and deactivated. We’ll be doing 1-to-1 comparisons, as well as some combos. We are going to measure load times, as well as some stats reported by Query Monitor such as memory usage, database query count etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Liuiza says benchmark results will be published in a series of posts on his blog and on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/\">Advanced WordPress Facbook group</a>. Liuiza is asking for the community&#8217;s help to locate plugins that are feature-comparable to the modules in Jetpack.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s also asking for advice on the testing methodology he and his students should use. There&#8217;s no timetable on when the results will be published as it&#8217;s considered a side project.</p>\n<h2>Benchmark Frontend Modules Only</h2>\n<p>Jetpack currently has 36 modules but some of them simply connect to services such as VaultPress or VideoPress. I think Liuiza and his team should concentrate on modules that potentially impact a site&#8217;s frontend performance as it doesn&#8217;t make sense to benchmark modules that are only for the backend.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m doubtful that an independent study of Jetpack&#8217;s performance will solve the issue once and for all, especially if the results show that it doesn&#8217;t have much of an impact on sites as people think. However, it will be nice to have another set of data to point people to when it comes up in discussions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Oct 2015 18:41:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"Matt: Accelerated Mobile Pages &amp; WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45475\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://ma.tt/2015/10/accelerated-mobile-pages-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:494:\"<p>As was just announced on <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/mobile-web/\">the VIP blog</a> and <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html\">Google</a>, there&#8217;s a new open standard that competes with (or complements) Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles.

In a post published on the company&#8217;s blog, <a href=\"http://10up.com/blog/2015/commitments-open-web/\">10up announced</a> it will continue to invest in WordPress and other open source projects it works with on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>According to the announcement, 10up is sponsoring Jaynes to work on WordPress full-time. The company has also created a Platform Engineer position and although it&#8217;s not hiring to fill the role, the company has left the title open-ended as it continues to support and build web platforms such as <a href=\"http://10up.com/blog/2015/sponsoring-sanitize-css/\">santize.css</a> and <a href=\"http://10up.com/blog/2014/varying-vagrant-vagrants-future/\">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>.</p>\n<h2>Sponsoring Scott Kingsley Clark to Work on the Fields API Project</h2>\n<p>In a major show of support, 10up is sponsoring 100 hours of <a href=\"http://scottkclark.com/\">Scott Kingsley Clark’s</a> company time to work on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API Project</a>. Announced in May, the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/05/27/metadata-api-project-reborn-the-new-fields-api-project/\">Fields API Project</a> is an offshoot of the Metadata API project. The Fields API would allow developers to register fields and sections for WordPress objects. According to Clark, the goal is to initially cover the following WordPress objects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customizer (retrofitting it beneath the existing Customizer API)</li>\n<li>User profile screen</li>\n<li>Post editor</li>\n<li>Settings screens (retrofitting it beneath the existing Settings API)</li>\n<li>And other areas in the future (Comment editor, Network Settings screens [see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15691\">#15691</a>], Media modals, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>10up believes that supporting the Fields API Project will help move it into a viable state to potentially be added to WordPress in the near-future, &#8220;As a company with a central mission of creating great publishing experiences, the user and developer experiences a fields API can improve are something we are particularly well-versed in,&#8221; Hou-Sandi said.</p>\n<p>Hou-Sandi goes on to explain that the web is built on open technologies that are usually maintained by small groups of people who rely on donations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The balance between use and support of open source software leans heavily toward use, and that imbalance has become even more apparent. Even with increased awareness around the plight of projects integral to a safe web, initiatives like OpenSSL continue to operate on small donations and the volunteer efforts of a few. It takes time to convert pledges into action, and we’ve yet to see very many pledges at all, much less action.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following quote written by Jake Goldman, <a href=\"http://10up.com/about/#employee-jake-goldman\">Founder and President of 10up</a>, explains why reinvesting in open source projects is so important not only for his company&#8217;s customers, but the WordPress userbase in general.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve said repeatedly that nothing is more critical to the success of agencies that rely on community, open source software platforms than the continued success of those platforms. It is incumbent upon those who have leveraged free, open platforms with success to share that success back.</p>\n<p>By economically enabling world-class engineers to improve open platforms, we not only ensure that our customers continue to have a first class solution, we enable the next generation of builders, who can’t yet afford such resources, to further grow our ecosystem and the platform’s demand. I believe this is the social contract of open source, and as 10up grows, so to will our contributions to open source. It’s not just responsible citizenship, it’s good business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It makes sense for companies whose businesses rely on open source software to find ways to reinvest time, energy, and money back into those projects less they disappear.

At the time, you could only do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plugin management:</strong> Turn plugins on or off with one click — per site or in bulk.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiate plugin updates:</strong> Update plugins for a single site or all sites in bulk.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic updates:</strong> Turn on auto-updates for any plugin on a per-site basis or in bulk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you can <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/2015/10/01/new-plugin-browser/\">browse and install plugins</a> from the WordPress plugin directory on sites you own that use Jetpack with the <a href=\"https://jetpack.me/support/site-management/\">Manage module</a> activated. Visit <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/plugins/browse\">https://wordpress.com/plugins/browse</a> and choose the site you want to manage.

Unlike the plugin browser in WordPress, the browser on WordPress.com displays new plugins.</p>\n<p>Both browsers display similar information in the detailed view with the exception that the WordPress.com browser doesn&#8217;t show a list of contributors. Enej Bajgorić, a member of the Jetpack development team, explains how to quickly install a plugin to a Jetpack site when browsing the WordPress plugin directory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you find yourself browsing the WordPress.org plugin repository and want to install the plugin on your Jetpack site, you can just replace the .org in the URL with .com and be taken to the new Plugin Browser where you can install the plugin with a single click. You will need to be logged into your WordPress.com account for this to work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A plugin browser to search for and install plugins is another feature that makes Jetpack Manage a free, decent alternative to commercial services for managing multiple sites. If you manage multiple sites with Jetpack Manage, let us know what you think and what key features you&#8217;d like to see added.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Oct 2015 18:29:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Matt: Interview in French\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45463\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://ma.tt/2015/10/interview-in-french/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:196:\"<p>Si vous parlez français, <a href=\"http://www.journaldunet.com/solutions/dsi/1161757-interview-de-matt-mullenweg/\">vous pourriez profiter de cette interview avec moi sur Journal Du Net</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Oct 2015 23:07:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Tom Nowell on How Automattic Keeps Workers Healthy and Happy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48490\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://wptavern.com/tom-nowell-on-how-automattic-keeps-workers-healthy-and-happy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12001:\"<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TomNowell.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48491\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TomNowell.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"Tom Nowell\" /></a>This post was contributed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tarendai\">Tom J Nowell</a>. Tom is a <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/vip-wrangler/\">VIP Wrangler</a> at <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com\">WordPress.com VIP</a>, lead of the <a href=\"http://www.wptherightway.org/en/index.html\">WP The Right Way</a> project, <a href=\"http://tomjn.com\">blogger</a>, and community moderator at <a href=\"https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/\">WordPress Stack Exchange</a>. Tom will be speaking at <a href=\"https://nyc.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp New York</a> later this month on escaping and security.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This is a story about my job as a <a href=\"http://vip.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">VIP Wrangler</a>, what <a href=\"http://automattic.com\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a> does to keep Automatticians happy, and my battles with anxiety, <a href=\"http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a>, and fear.</p>\n<h2>Joining the VIP Team</h2>\n<p>Almost a year ago, I worked for <a href=\"http://codeforthepeople.com/\">Code For The People</a>, a six person development agency that was in acquisition talks with Automattic. I remember at the beginning of the week, we thought an acquisition could happen before Christmas and by the following Friday, we were signing new employment contracts, and booking tickets to Lisbon for the VIP team meet up!</p>\n<p>I remember being the first to arrive, surrounded by people from the VIP team I&#8217;ve never met in person. We went out for dinner, learned how to do deploys, visited aquariums, gardens, and then went home.</p>\n<h2>The Happiness Rotation</h2>\n<p>After the meet up, I spent two months finishing contracts and started my Happiness Rotation. A happiness rotation is three weeks of working on the WordPress.com support team to get in touch with the problems end users are facing. Every Automattician has to go through a happiness rotation as part of their trial.</p>\n<p>Working the happiness rotation was hard. When I say this, I don&#8217;t mean it was an insurmountable task. I had a full-time Happiness Engineer available 24/7 to ask any question I wanted, a week of walkthroughs, supervised working, mountains of documentation, pre-written examples, and slack channels with friendly supportive people. I knew what to do, how to do it, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/736/tom-j-nowell\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;ve done it before</a>.</p>\n<h2>VIP Training</h2>\n<p>Despite this, I struggled, and VIP training began. Work at VIP fits into several sub roles that developers cycle through and training consists of a week in each role mentored by an experienced VIP Wrangler. Afterwards, we continue the cycle as full VIP Wranglers. Throughout the entire process, I had a general mentor for any and all things Automattic, be it mystery acronyms, or how to book a holiday.</p>\n<p>At this point, I realized my job had grown in scope and felt insurmountable. I didn&#8217;t know what was going on and there was still much to learn. Combined with a torrent of new notifications, p2s, and emails, I felt lost. GitHub scaled from two to three emails per day to hundreds, P2 posts filled my other inbox, people asked difficult questions, and the sheer amount of activity at Automattic was overwhelming.</p>\n<h2>Dealing With Adversity</h2>\n<p>In the last few years, I viewed Automattic as my career end goal and suddenly I was there, years ahead of schedule. Not just that, I was struggling. I couldn&#8217;t grasp what was going on and I felt paralyzed in the face of work. I grappled with the thought that I was bad at my job, didn&#8217;t belong there, and that I wouldn&#8217;t last the next six months. I had this feeling that at any time, they were going to pull me into a call and say it isn&#8217;t working out.</p>\n<p>A number of questions ran through my head. What would people think if they saw I left after the acquisition? Everyone&#8217;s treating it as a promotion and congratulating me. Maybe I&#8217;m not ready? I was handed a theme to review and struggling to read basic lines of code, mulling it over in my mind, why can&#8217;t I do this?</p>\n<p>Sometimes I had the wrong window open and was reviewing my code but was so preoccupied, I didn&#8217;t realize it. Today, it takes me four days to review 6,000 lines of code in a theme but at the time, it took me two weeks to move through 1,000 lines.</p>\n<h2>The Catch Up Calls</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s at this point that I was introduced to the bi-weekly catch up call. The team leads would chat with each person individually every two weeks to find out how they were, what they were doing, and what they&#8217;d like to do the following week. It was a chance to flag any problems and plan ahead.</p>\n<p>I experienced nothing like this at CFTP or at any of my previous jobs and combined with the stalling work on the review, I panicked. My first catch up call was awkward and didn&#8217;t last long. My second catch up call didn&#8217;t go so well. I was at WordCamp Norway preparing to give a talk on <a href=\"http://www.wptherightway.org/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">WP The Right Way</a>. I sat in a quiet room and received a call on a Skype from my team lead.</p>\n<p>I felt as though I was put on the spot having to justify what I&#8217;d been doing the last two weeks, and trying to figure out how to spin weeks of panicking in front of a computer into a tale of bountiful code reviewing, pleasant Norwegian winters, and a smile.</p>\n<h2>Recovering From the Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Instead, I closed my machine and burst into tears. A few minutes later I opened my machine, apologized, and tried to explain what had happened. I was told they didn&#8217;t care how much work I was doing as long as I was learning and happy. A colleague picked up the review I was working on and noted that I was  thorough with the parts I reviewed.</p>\n<p>My team lead, Steph, checked up on me every two to three days for the next two weeks to make sure I was okay and tried to find what kind of work I took to best. I spent time on deploys, then moved on to a long rotation doing code review so that I could focus on particular tasks and build my confidence.</p>\n<p>While this was happening, another colleague asked if I was okay as he thought I was down. He introduced me to an internal slack channel called <a href=\"http://bluehackers.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluehackers</a> where other Automatticians who struggled could share their experiences. Seeing other people talk candidly about their problems made me recognize a lot of things I hadn&#8217;t considered, the most important being that I wasn&#8217;t alone.</p>\n<h2>I&#8217;m Not Alone</h2>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t the only one who struggled some days and failed to get anything done. I wasn&#8217;t the only one who panicked when faced with new or even familiar tasks. Everyone at VIP was friendly and supportive, not because they knew of my situation, but because they are nice people. One time, my technical lead sent me three family sized pies because we had a slack discussion on pudding.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I don&#8217;t get anything done. Sometimes I struggle to do things I normally do effortlessly. Sometimes I turn off the video in calls because I&#8217;m still in bed. It&#8217;s 3PM and I can&#8217;t bring myself to get up, changed, and eat. There are so many projects I want to do. I have the knowledge, I have the resources, the support, the time, but they don&#8217;t get done, and it&#8217;s a struggle to explain why. Sometimes it&#8217;s things I know that need doing, like buying food or paying bills.</p>\n<h2>Confirmation Things are Working Out</h2>\n<p>A few months later I was in Seville at WordCamp Europe. Initially, I wasn&#8217;t going to go but decided I would regret it if I didn&#8217;t. I threw some clothes in a suitcase and purchased a flight. Large groups of people are scary, but I&#8217;ve found WordCamps tend to have familiar friendly faces mixed in. I can&#8217;t stress how big a boost it is to be able to see and make friends from event to event, yet still meet new people.</p>\n<p>Before I left, I found myself with my former boss and now colleague. He asked how I was getting along at Automattic. He asked me this before, and I said, &#8220;It was rough at the start but I think I&#8217;m there now.&#8221; He told me that everyone else at the company thought good of me and that I was fitting in well. It might have been simple statement but it meant a lot to me.</p>\n<h2>A Bout of Impostor Syndrome</h2>\n<p>I had real moments when I went to sleep thinking I was going to lose my job, that I might not be cut out to be a developer, and that I didn&#8217;t deserve the things I had. But throughout the entire process, my team leads and my colleagues tried to support me. They placed my well-being first and they proactively asked if I was ok when they suspected something was wrong, and sought to put real solutions in place where they could.</p>\n<p>They found other people with similar problems and tried to give me the ability to express what was happening, sharing their own problems coping, and what they were doing to keep on top of them. They gave praise and listened to good ideas, asked for help when they needed it, and they understood. Right now, I&#8217;m ok, but things have a habit of creeping up unnoticed, triggered by unexpected things.</p>\n<p>I get anxious about food at WordCamps if I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s being served, I&#8217;m uncomfortable in social situations, and at times I have problems gathering the energy to do day-to-day things, but I&#8217;m lucky. I have a good job, a nice family, a comfortable apartment, and interesting work. My problems are mild and I know others have it worse. Most people are going to pretend everything&#8217;s ok but everyone needs a little help.</p>\n<h2>Suggestions for Employers and Struggling Employees</h2>\n<p>Automattic has things in place to make sure Automatticians lead healthy mental lives. We have an unlimited holiday allowance, a small expense budget to make traveling easier (e.g. a pot of tea at an airport or a massage), team meet ups, sabbaticals, and many others. Matt Mullenweg doesn&#8217;t want Automatticians to struggle, we work hard and it takes its toll. Often, we forget that we have to take care of our emotional and mental needs and give ourselves time.</p>\n<p>Consider creating your own internal Bluehackers group and give people avenues to express themselves when they need to. Make sure they&#8217;re happy, and that you care about their well-being more than their quality of work and output as reassurance goes a long way. Some companies have gone as far as setting minimum holiday allowances to force employees to spend time on themselves.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re dealing with problems like these, talk about it. Talk to a GP/Doctor, a friend, family, whatever works for you. Talking is hard, but it&#8217;s necessary. If someone opens up to you, listen. Don&#8217;t try to offer solutions, don&#8217;t compare and contrast, don&#8217;t try to offer sympathy, don&#8217;t expect it to be sorted out in a month&#8217;s time. Simply listen as that person chose to tell you, so give them space and respect.</p>\n<p>If you suspect someone is down, ask them if they&#8217;re ok and if you notice they bounce back, tell them, and tell them you&#8217;re glad! Highlight interesting things that happen, help them when they make a mistake, ask them when you make one yourself. But remember, sometimes all someone needs is a hug and a cup of tea to know that things are ok. Give them space, don&#8217;t ask for explanations, and let them know you&#8217;re there if you need them.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Oct 2015 17:11:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Post Status: How WordPress core development happens — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://poststatus.com/how-wordpress-core-development-happens-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2409:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher. Brian and his guest co-host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba\">Brad Williams</a> discuss some of today’s hottest, current WordPress news.</p>\n<p>This week Brian and Brad talk about how to get involved in WordPress core, what to expect when you do, how to navigate the waters of core development. They also discuss term meta, its use cases, how it works, and why it’s a great feature for WordPress 4.4.</p>\n<p>Brad is guest hosting this week, as Joe is out.

Since launching in 2008, Hesketh&#8217;s videos have been viewed more than a million times by over 500k people. He&#8217;s also re-recorded the videos that make up the WP101 series 17 times. With seven years of experience under his belt, I asked Hesketh what he would have done differently in the beginning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From a technical standpoint, I wish I’d picked a solid membership plugin that would have enabled us to grow. We’re planning a costly migration in the coming months, and a better membership plugin might have saved us the considerable hassle and cost,&#8221; Hesketh told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Technical issues aside, Hesketh believes his business&#8217; success is largely due to his focus on serving people, &#8220;It’s one thing to create an online course and hope people discover it. But it takes much more dedication to actually engage people on a daily basis, take the time to understand their goals, and then help them get clear on how to accomplish those goals,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Hesketh doesn&#8217;t have any regrets but wishes he launched the question and answer forum on the first day, &#8220;Its given me the opportunity to answer questions that may not be covered in our videos. That’s the real value that WP101 brings to the table, real people helping others,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WP101 launched around the same time as a lot of commercial theme shops such as iThemes, StudioPress, and WooThemes. Although WP101 doesn&#8217;t sell commercial themes or plugins, Hesketh has carved out a space in the WordPress ecosystem that enables him to make a living. If you use WP101 or have in the past, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think of his videos in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Oct 2015 01:33:12
