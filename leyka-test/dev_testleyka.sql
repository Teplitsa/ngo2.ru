The WordPress community and the tech industry in general are <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community\" target=\"_blank\">growing in the Balkans</a>. A large contingency of Croatian WordPress enthusiasts were present at neighboring <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/belgrades-first-wordcamp-sells-out-plans-to-double-attendees-next-year\" target=\"_blank\">Serbia&#8217;s first WordCamp in Belgrade</a> earlier this year. The <a href=\"http://wpcroatia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Croatian WP community</a> has now grown large enough to host its own event.</p>\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start gaining popularity in Croatia until 2013, but the country is now home to four thriving WordPress meetups in Zagreb, Split, Pula, and Rijeka. Local organizers decided to band together to apply for a country-wide WordCamp, instead of dividing it into smaller ones. They plan to rotate the location every year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijeka\" target=\"_blank\">Rijeka</a>, the first host for WordCamp Croatia, is a multicultural city nestled on the Adriatic coast near Slovenia and Italy. It is well connected to nearby European capitals by air and train. Organizers are hoping to cultivate a &#8220;cozy and family–like atmosphere&#8221; for the event. <a href=\"http://business.croatia.hr/hr-HR/Poslovni-turizam/Kongresni-centri/Mjesto/Rijeka/Kongresni-centar/Hrvatski-kulturni-dom-na-Susaku?bGNcNDc0NjUscFwzODQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">HKD Sušak</a>, the venue selected, has a capacity for up to 300 attendees.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Croatia will be a three-day event that will include educational workshops and tracks on Friday, the full conference on Saturday, and a Contributor Day on Sunday. The <a href=\"https://croatia.wordcamp.org/2015/call-for-speakers/\" target=\"_blank\">call for speakers</a> is open as of today and the deadline for proposals is July 5. Organizers will be accepting presentations in both English and Croatian.

Navigation in the app has been redesigned to remove the the hamburger button in favor of four simplified tabs spanning the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>The ubiquitous hamburger icon, used on apps and websites for years, is slowly <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/before-the-hamburger-button-kills-you/\" target=\"_blank\">falling out of fashion</a> on the web. While the side navigation drawer does a good job of keeping nav items out of sight, <a href=\"https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/\" target=\"_blank\">it comes at the cost of user engagement</a>. Hamburger menus are also inconvenient for one-handed device operation.</p>\n<p>Version 4.1 of WordPress for Android has been redesigned to display a tabbed action bar with quick access to your sites, the reader, user account settings, and notifications. The sites menu will allow you to manage any of your connected sites and includes a short menu for publishing, stats, theme customization, and access to the full dashboard.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tag-autocompletion.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tag-autocompletion.png?resize=219%2C300\" alt=\"tag-autocompletion\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-45367\" /></a>Another new feature in 4.1 is tag auto-completion. When adding a tag on the post settings screen, users will now receive suggestions (based on existing tags) while typing.</p>\n<p>Stats have also been improved to provide a noticeably faster viewing experience. The app now takes just a fraction of the time it previously required to load stats data. Interacting with this feature no longer feels like visiting a foreign land.</p>\n<p>Overall the 4.1 release is a big leap forward for WordPress&#8217; usability on Android. The navigation redesign is more intuitive and smaller features are continuing to be refined with each release. The 4.1 update should have already hit devices, so Android users can open up the app to check out everything that&#8217;s new.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 17:23:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Matt: $3 Websites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45159\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/3-websites/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:772:\"<blockquote><p>And remember the $5 billion website, 5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn’t work.

This isn&#8217;t it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ryan McCue, one of the lead developers on the WP REST API project, joined the discussion to encourage BackPress supporters to consider making it into a feature plugin, which he believes would be a more productive avenue for radical experimentation.</p>\n<p>Sivan pointed out that the problem with this path is that it still requires the use of a plugin, whereas BackPress is meant for developers who don&#8217;t want to have to install WordPress and plugins in order to experiment with it.</p>\n<p>Responding to commenters on yesterday&#8217;s post, Sivan <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/backpress-is-coming-back-from-the-dead#comment-69416\" target=\"_blank\">summarized</a> his thoughts about pursuing BackPress as a feature plugin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the takeaway from today is to decide what it is the development community wants out of WordPress, and see if feature plugins are the way to go, or if there is some validity in building out this system (whatever it may be called) as what we hope can be re-integrated into core at some point. Whether that means taking backwards compatibility into account or not has yet to be seen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;It would probably be better to start from scratch; it’s not even close to up to date with current WP code it was meant to emulate,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said in response to the idea. &#8220;It’s a fun experiment regardless, especially if people don’t think of it as Official WordPress Policy or Future (which it isn’t).&#8221;</p>\n<p>After nearly three hours of discussion about possible ways forward, those present concluded that it would be best to reconvene next week to identify the problems that BackPress would solve. Most of those in attendance were developers passionate about creating a more flexible, modular WordPress and willing to see if a BackPress revival could be a possibility for addressing that.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our conversation touched on the high level and next steps are coming, and we are planning on meeting next week same day, at 2PM (PST)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Roy Sivan (@royboy789) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royboy789/status/610943668388802560\">June 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Organizers created a<a href=\"https://github.com/royboy789/helium\" target=\"_blank\"> GitHub repository for exploring a new BackPress</a> and will meet every Tuesday at 2PM PST.

Following an overwhelming amount of negative feedback from the community, core contributors <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-contributors-call-for-user-testing-on-the-menu-customizer-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">published what was essentially a rallying call to get the plugin ready for merge</a>, reaffirming their commitment to iterating with the customizer.</p>\n<p>Nick Halsey, the plugin&#8217;s developer, published a number of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/flow/2015/06/14/menus-in-the-admin-and-the-customizer-ux-flow-performance-comparisons/\" target=\"_blank\">UX flow and performance comparisons</a> of the admin menus screen vs. menus in the customizer.

I ran into a few areas where the experience could be improved, but in terms of timing, the Customizer version wins in most of these scenarios currently. Note that this is intended to compare the experience for power users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Menu Customizer is one of the most controversial new features added to core in WordPress&#8217; recent history. It will be interesting to see how it plays out when users discover it in 4.3.

The result is instantaneous searching that doesn&#8217;t require pressing enter or refreshing the page.</p>\n<p>WP Live Search is very much a working prototype but also provides a practical example of the WP REST API in action. I tested the plugin and the short clip below shows an example of searching through thousands of articles. Each result is displayed neatly with its corresponding featured image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-live-search.gif\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-live-search.gif?resize=1016%2C488\" alt=\"wp-live-search\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45268\" /></a></p>\n<p>Haskins created the client-side search plugin to power the new search feature inside <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/lasso-frontend-editing-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">Lasso</a>, his frontend editing plugin. He released the prototype on WordPress.org in order to get usability testing and feedback from a larger group of users. He&#8217;s also building the plugin as part of his day job, so it&#8217;s being developed with several different audiences in mind.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using the REST API was super important because we&#8217;re searching on &#8216;keyup&#8217; and if that went through admin-ajax.php then shared hosts would likely melt down,&#8221; Haskins said. &#8220;So because it&#8217;s all client-side, it&#8217;s super lightweight and anything can run it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The feature is already built into Lasso but will not be released until Haskins has the chance to gather more feedback.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested to see HOW users search, is the search too fast, is it too slow, etc.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All of this will lead to a perfect search feature inside of Lasso.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haskins was previously hesitant to utilize the WP REST API before it has landed in WordPress core but the recent progress and momentum on the project inspired him to go for it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was avoiding the REST API, but with a tentative merge this fall, and V2 going out, I think the time is ripe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In using the REST API, I&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s very use case dependent and is really just another tool. There&#8217;s a time and place for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Live Search is still under active development and may not be suitable for use in production just yet, but is functional and ready for testing. Here&#8217;s how to take it for a spin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-search-live/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Live Search</a>.</li>\n<li>Install the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/\" target=\"_blank\">WP REST API</a> plugin.</li>\n<li>Add the shortcode [wp_live_search] to a page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The shortcode accepts a few attributes, including type, placeholder, results, and target. More details are available on the plugin&#8217;s description <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-search-live/\" target=\"_blank\">page</a>.</p>\n<p>Haskins plans to add support for custom post types in the next major update to the plugin.

They will be discussing their plans to bring it back to life on a live Google Hangout at 1PM PST (8pm UTC) today, June 16.</p>\n<p>BackPress is a PHP library of core functionality for web applications. It essentially provides the core of bbPress and powers the GlotPress application, which enables WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress to be translated into different languages.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that bbPress project lead John James Jacoby is an ardent fan of BackPress, but few could have predicted that the project would be making a come back. In Sivan&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/970129579715923/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> in the Advanced WordPress Facebook group, he briefly outlined their intentions for BackPress&#8217; future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a few conversations at WordCamp Miami, we both want to bring it back. My vision is for it to be up to date with current WP, and for it to be the WP you install when you don&#8217;t want the Dashboard, but to build something from scratch using modules / plugins.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Commenters responded positively to the announcement and Sivan and Jacoby plan to open the project up to contributors in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current state of BackPress is a mess,&#8221; Sivan said. &#8220;Unfortunately, it can&#8217;t be just overwritten, so our main goal is to talk action plan, how to get it to a place that is more up to date, then start adding modularity to it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My vision is you still get the easy installer, but things like wp-admin are just modules, and even modular within that per UI, but that shall be discussed as we move forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once the BackPress code is up to date, the duo hope to turn it into a usable starting point for application development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This + JSON REST API could be the next evolution of WordPress for developers,&#8221; Sivan said.</p>\n<p>For more details on the history of BackPress, check out Jeff Chandler&#8217;s 2010 <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/interview-with-beau-lebens-talking-backpress\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Beau Lebens</a>.

Founder Jason Lemieux and his team launched the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/postmatic-launches-100-email-based-commenting-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">100% email-based commenting service</a> in April and have been steadily adding importers for users of other various comment subscription plugins. Postmatic launched with importers for Mailpoet, Mailchimp, and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/postmatic-now-supports-1-click-migration-of-subscribers-from-jetpack\" target=\"_blank\">one-click migration of subscribers from Jetpack</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe to Comments</a> is a popular old plugin created by Mark Jaquith and is currently in use on 80,000+ installations. The plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated for more than two years and many users in its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/subscribe-to-comments\" target=\"_blank\">support forums</a> are eagerly looking for an alternative.</p>\n<p>With over 80,000 sites depending on an older, unmaintained plugin, Lemieux and his team saw a ripe opportunity to create an importer to fill the gap. Subscribe to Comments users can conveniently migrate with one click:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve built a new migration tool into Postmatic 1.2.3 which will allow Subscribe to Comments users to convert their legacy subscribers into shiny new Postmatic subscribers. It all happens with just one click, invisibly, in the background. From then on out notifications of new comments will be sent to old subscribers except this time they’ll be able to continue the conversation by just hitting reply.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The migration tool also works with variations of Subscribe to Comments, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-comments-reloaded/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe to Comments Reloaded</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-double-opt-in-comments/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe to Double-Opt-In Comments</a>. The importer is another strategic addition that will likely win Postmatic more new users.</p>\n<p>Postmatic is aiming to become a big player in WordPress comments and is continuing to build out more products centered around enhancing engagement. In addition to expanding the user base of the free Postmatic plugin, the team is also busy beta testing Epoch, its next major release.

In a recent interview with WP Tavern, Matt Mullenweg confirmed that the o2 development team is <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/o2-development-team-shifts-focus-to-wordpress-coms-core-products\" target=\"_blank\">shifting its focus to WordPress.com&#8217;s core products</a> but that the o2 code would be public for anyone to use.</p>\n<p>o2 was is the successor to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/\" target=\"_blank\">P2</a>, the innovative group blogging theme created to power communications at Automattic. P2 was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/p2-officially-on-the-theme-repository\" target=\"_blank\">released in 2009</a> with the tagline &#8220;Blogging at the speed of thought.&#8221; It introduced quick posting from the front page and real-time updates.</p>\n<p>o2 shares P2&#8217;s tagline but, unlike its predecessor, it was created to be a plugin that is not dependent on a specific theme.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devinsays\">@devinsays</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelarestad\">@michaelarestad</a> that\'s the theory!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kevin Conboy (@alternatekev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alternatekev/status/610413606446825473\">June 15, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not guaranteed to work with any theme, so if you want the best experience you should test it out with the <a href=\"https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe\" target=\"_blank\">p2-breathe theme</a>, as recommended in the GitHub installation instructions. o2 requires the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/genericond/\" target=\"_blank\">Genericon&#8217;d</a> plugin and if you want the ability to insert code blocks, it requires the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/\" target=\"_blank\">SyntaxHighlighter Evolved</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>The readme.txt on GitHub cautions that &#8220;multisite self-hosted installs have not yet been tested and may not work.&#8221; Although the plugin was written to shine within a network environment with cross-site search and cross-site posting, the network features are not guaranteed to work for self-hosted users. However, the improved real-time commenting, drag-and-drop media upload, and other enhancements may make using O2 worthwhile on single site WordPress installations.</p>\n<p>A cursory look at the issues queue indicates that some of the features that work on WordPress.com may still be buggy for self-hosted installations, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/o2/issues/3\" target=\"_blank\">@mentions in posts in comments</a>. The good news for those who were eagerly awaiting o2&#8217;s release is that the code, while not completely polished and bug-free, is now <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/o2\" target=\"_blank\">public on GitHub</a>. Even though Automattic is shifting its focus away from the project, anyone who wants to help improve it can submit a pull request or fork o2 for their own use.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 17:30:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Matt: Priceless Words\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45151\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/priceless-words/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:405:\"<blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s easy to be very busy but not get anything done that you&#8217;ll look back a year from now and say was worthwhile.”</p>\n<p>“You&#8217;ll get a lot of contradictory advice, and often neither side is wrong.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Entrepreneur.com <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246745\">collected a few quotes from me and blogged some context for each</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 01:25:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Matt: How Tesla Will Change The World\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45149\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-the-world/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:149:\"<p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\">How Tesla Will Change The World</a> from the great Wait But Why.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 23:25:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Matt: Munchery Eating the World\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45143\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/munchery-eating-the-world/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:380:\"<p>Shervin has an amazing write-up on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shervin/how-munchery-is-literally-eating-the-world-218c6520dc99\">how Munchery is literally eating the world</a>, and Sherpa&#8217;s continuing investment there.

Okay, fine. Here are my favorite parts:</p>\n<h3>Where is code?</h3>\n<p>While the entire article answers, &#8220;What is code?&#8221;, he starts by answering, &#8220;Where is code?&#8221; Code is much broader than the web. It&#8217;s pervasive. Everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most programmers aren’t working on building a widely recognized application like Microsoft Word. Software is everywhere. It’s gone from a craft of fragile, built-from-scratch custom projects to an industry of standardized parts, where coders absorb and improve upon the labors of their forebears (even if those forebears are one cubicle over). Software is there when you switch channels and your cable box shows you what else is on. You get money from an ATM—software. An elevator takes you up five stories—the same. Facebook releases software every day to something like a billion people, and that software runs inside Web browsers and mobile applications. Facebook looks like it’s just pictures of your mom’s crocuses or your son’s school play—but no, it’s software.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Computers are dumb</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\">Until they&#8217;re not</a>. But today, computers really don&#8217;t know anything; they return things based on what we put in them, and they can do so many things faster than we can.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every character truly, truly matters. Every single stupid misplaced semicolon, space where you meant tab, bracket instead of a parenthesis—mistakes can leave the computer in a state of panic. The trees don’t know where to put their leaves. Their roots decay. The boxes don’t stack neatly. For not only are computers as dumb as a billion marbles, they’re also positively Stradivarian in their delicacy.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Programming languages</h3>\n<p>Paul spends a ton of time talking about various programming languages, their origins, their styles, their adoptions, their usefulness, and how they&#8217;ve evolved.</p>\n<p>He primarily focuses on C (and how it&#8217;s fast but not object oriented) and Java (and how it&#8217;s object oriented but not fast, relatively). Amazingly, he manages to talk about many, many languages, their attributes, and yet explain them in a way that nearly anyone can understand.</p>\n<p>I have to admit something: I am so far from a classically trained developer that I found this focus of the article to be incredibly educational. I learned the wrong way, from the tip of the pyramid down. If you consider markup and styles the very tip, and then WordPress is a bit below that as a framework for PHP &#8212; and you are still only part way down the pyramid. PHP is built with C and C compiles to machine code. His article helped me understand the pyramid from the other direction much better.</p>\n<h3>Programmer culture</h3>\n<p>An important piece of the article was around culture. He spends time both on programmer attitudes and broader programming culture, such as conferences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Languages have agendas. People glom onto them. Blunt talk is seen as a good quality in a developer, a sign of an “engineering mindset”—spit out every opinion as quickly as possible, the sooner to reach a technical consensus. Expect to be told you’re wrong; expect to tell other people they’re wrong. (Masculine anger, bluntly expressed, is part of the industry.)</p>\n<p>Coding is a culture of blurters. This can yield fast decisions, but it penalizes people who need to quietly compose their thoughts, rewarding fast-twitch thinkers who harrumph efficiently. Programmer job interviews, which often include abstract and meaningless questions that must be answered immediately on a whiteboard, typify this culture. Regular meetings can become sniping matches about things that don’t matter. The shorthand term for that is “bikeshedding.” (Who cares what color the bike shed is painted? Well …)</p>\n<p>Code culture is very, very broad, but the geographic and cultural core is the Silicon Valley engine of progress. The Valley mythologizes young geniuses with vast sums. To its credit, this culture works; to its shame, it doesn’t work for everyone.</p>\n<p>At any moment some new thing could catch fire and disrupt the tribal ebb and flow. Instagram was written in Python and sold for $2 billion, so Python had a moment of glory. The next mind-blowing app could show up, written in some new language—and start everyone taking that more seriously. Within 18 months your skills could be, if not quite valueless, suspect.</p>\n<p>I was in a meeting once where someone said, “How long will it take to fix that?” One person, who’d been at the company for years, said, “Three months.” A new person, who’d just come from a world of rapidly provisioned cloud microservices, said, “Three minutes.” They were both correct. That’s how change enters into this world. Slowly at first, then on the front page of Hacker News.</p>\n<p>Programmers carve out a sliver of cognitive territory for themselves and go to conferences, and yet they know their position is vulnerable. They get defensive when they hear someone suggest that Python is better than Ruby, because [insert 500-comment message thread here]. Is the next great wave swelling somewhere, and will it wash away Java when it comes? Will Go conquer Python? Do I need to learn JavaScript to remain profitable? Programmers are often angry because they’re often scared. We are, most of us, stumbling around with only a few candles to guide the way. We can’t always see the whole system, so we need to puzzle it out, bit by bit, in the dark.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And his passage on the decreasing percentages of female coders is pure perfection:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The average programmer is moderately diligent, capable of basic mathematics, has a working knowledge of one or more programming languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to management and his or her peers. Given that a significant number of women work as journalists and editors, perform surgery, run companies, manage small businesses, and use spreadsheets, that a few even serve on the Supreme Court, and that we are no longer surprised to find women working as accountants, professors, statisticians, or project managers, it’s hard to imagine that they can’t write JavaScript. Programming, despite the hype and the self-serving fantasies of programmers the world over, isn’t the most intellectually demanding task imaginable.</p>\n<p>Which leads one to the inescapable conclusion: The problem with women in technology isn’t the women.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>PHP and (sorta) WordPress</h3>\n<p>Of everything discussed in the article, the one thing I really could tell he didn&#8217;t appreciate much was PHP.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can get a site up and running in PHP in a few minutes, and that’s the problem. It used to be the terrible choice you made when you needed to get something done on the Web, but increasingly JavaScript has replaced it as the default terrible choice.</p>\n<p>PHP stands for Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter. The idea was that when you loaded your Web pages, the PHP code would run before the page went out to the Internet. And PHP could, say, check whether you were logged in. If you were, it could show you your top secret account details; and if you weren’t, it could say, “Please log in.”</p>\n<p>I know a lot of people who program in PHP, and they are smart, good people. PHP powers Etsy and Facebook. It powers Wikipedia, for God’s sake. WordPress. Out of all the Web’s pages, an enormous percentage is created with PHP.</p>\n<p>Coding in PHP for a living is not a death sentence. Lots of people have gotten rich off PHP. It just means a lot of cutting and pasting, and a lot of trips to Google to figure out why things aren’t working.</p>\n<p>Poor, sad, misbegotten, incredibly effective, massively successful PHP. Reading PHP code is like reading poetry, the poetry you wrote freshman year of college.</p>\n<p>I spent so many hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours programming in PHP, back when I didn’t know what I was doing and neither did PHP. Reloading Web pages until my fingers were sore. (I can hear your sympathetic sobs.) Everything was always broken, and people were always hacking into my sites.</p>\n<p>PHP. I don’t wish it any harm. I’m glad to see how well it’s done for itself. We had some good times together. I just don’t ever want to go back there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also uses WordPress as the punching bag for the story in the story. The fictional story within the article is of a company that&#8217;s replacing their current website with a new website. It&#8217;s a big corporate environment and they&#8217;re, &#8220;at the limits with WordPress.&#8221; Of course, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/paul-ford-what-is-code-bloomberg/\">Matt Mullenweg took issue</a> with that one aspect on his own blog.</p>\n<h3>Debugging, testing, and version control</h3>\n<p>Paul gives some of the best layman&#8217;s descriptions for debugging, testing, and version control I&#8217;ve ever read. He closes the section with this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>See, tests and version control are now the trigger for actually shipping code. If you can follow a process like this, you can release software several times a day—which in the days of shrink-wrapped software would have been folly. (Often builds were done nightly, by big “build servers,” and one would come in the next morning to get the score.) But now that software can be released via the Web or an app store, why wait? Why not continually release software, every day, whenever you have something that’s ready to go?</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Actually picking a language</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to limit this one and it was one of my favorite parts, so I&#8217;m just going to toss it in in bulk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beware of arguments related to programming speed. All things being equal, faster is better. But all things are never equal. Do you need the kind of speed that lets you get a website up and running quickly? Or the kind that allows you to rotate a few thousand polygons in 3D in real time? Do you need to convert 10,000 PDFs into text per hour? Or 10 million PDFs into text once? These are different problems. What do we need to do, how many times do we need to do it, and what existing code can we use to help us do it that many times? Ask those questions.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to spend productive months preparing for a project without deciding on a language. It may be the sign of a fine manager, someone who assumes his people can learn new things, someone who’s built an agile team capable of experimenting with new technologies and getting ideas into production. It could also be that this person is totally useless. You’ll find out!</p>\n<p>Let’s say your programmers are developing a huge website that serves 5 million people who each visit five times a month. Do you use Python, which is slower, or Go, which is fast, or Node.js, which is something in-between? Trick question! Twenty-five million Web page visits isn’t that big a deal, unless they involve some deep wizardry or complex database queries that are very different for each page (good example: Facebook).</p>\n<p>Now, that number isn’t trivial; if it takes a minute to make a page, you’d need 48 years to make that many, which is way too slow. If it takes a second to make a page, that’s still too slow—there are only 2.6 million seconds in a month. So you need to figure out how to serve about 10 pages per second. You’ll probably want more than one computer, a little redundancy, some good server setup. It will take some doing and planning. But it can be done in any language.</p>\n<p>What if you are going to serve only a few hundred thousand pages a month? Then you’ve got tremendous breathing room. You don’t need too many engineers to create the system architecture. You still need to plan, but in general you can read some blog posts and follow along with what others have done. You can be pretty sloppy, to be honest. Again, any language will do.</p>\n<p>What if you want to include a live, person-to-person chat on those pages, and you expect thousands of people to use that chat at once, all speaking to each other? Now you’re dipping your hand into that godforsaken river. But that is exactly the problem that Go was designed to solve. It’s a language for creating highly available servers that use as much of the computer’s processor as possible. It has other features as well, but this is where Go shines. Actually, Node.js works pretty well for that sort of server, too, and Clojure certainly has the capacity. Oh, right, Java works, too. If you really needed to, you could even do it in PHP.</p>\n<p>This is why the choice is so hard. Everything can do everything, and people will tell you that you should use everything to do everything. So you need to figure out for yourself what kind of team you have, what kind of frameworks you like using, where people can be most productive, so they will stick around through the completion of the project. This is hard. Most places can’t do this. So they go with the lowest common denominator—Java, PHP—because they know that when people leave, they’ll be able to get more of them.</p>\n<p>And that’s OK. The vast majority of technology projects don’t require original research, nor do they require amazing technological discoveries. All the languages under discussion work just fine. There are great coders in all of them.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Should you learn to code?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only highlighted some of my favorite parts.

While there are already hundreds of lightbox plugins available for WordPress, this one may prove to be the &#8220;lightest&#8221; of them all.</p>\n<p>The plugin is essentially a wrapper for the <a href=\"http://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/\" target=\"_blank\">Featherlight jQuery lightbox script</a> created by Noel Bossart. Featherlight.js was designed to be very lightweight and is just 400 lines of JavaScript, 100 of CSS, and less than 6kB combined. It works on IE8+, all modern browsers, and on mobile platforms. The script is responsive and supports images, ajax, and iframes out of the box.</p>\n<p>WP Featherlight solves a number of problems that WordPress users often encounter with lightbox plugins, many of which contain a load of heavy-handed styling that is difficult to override.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were having a really hard time finding a lightbox plugin that was simple to customize, but that was also lightweight, flexible, and didn’t add a bunch of bloat to our website,&#8221; WP Site Care founder Ryan Sullivan said in his <a href=\"http://www.wpsitecare.com/wp-featherlight/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> introducing the plugin.</p>\n<p>The WP Site Care team opted to build their own solution on top of Featherlight.js. The resulting plugin provides a fast, minimalist style popup for images and galleries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-featherlight-screenshot.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-featherlight-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C786\" alt=\"wp-featherlight-screenshot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45168\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes built-in support for native WordPress galleries and <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack galleries</a>. When you install it, there are no options to configure. It will automatically display all images and galleries in a lightbox. If you <a href=\"https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight/#usage\" target=\"_blank\">add some extra data attributes to your content</a>, it&#8217;s also possible to display videos, iframes, and ajax content with WP Featherlight.</p>\n<p>The demo video below shows how the plugin works with galleries to click from one image to the next while in the lightbox.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>One common problem with WordPress lightbox plugins is that they usually load their scripts and styles on every page, whether you need the lightbox there or not. WP Featherlight gives you the option in the post editor to disable the lightbox. It&#8217;s a handy option to have in case you don&#8217;t want to load a larger version of your images on that particular post/page, but I&#8217;m not sure why you wouldn&#8217;t just conditionally load the scripts on pages that have images.</p>\n<p>I tested WP Featherlight on a demo site and found that it works as advertised. You would be hard pressed to find a leaner lightbox plugin for WordPress. The style is super minimal and the fact that there are no options to configure makes it a pleasure to use.

The changelog is a communication channel that bridges the gap between me and the developer.</p>\n<p>It tells me what&#8217;s changed, what to expect, and any other information the developer thinks I should know. The most important information a developer can tell me is that a security vulnerability has been addressed.</p>\n<p>Security vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins generally receive a decent amount of media coverage. If I read a story that mentions a plugin I use containing a vulnerability, the first thing I do is visit that plugin&#8217;s changelog on the WordPress plugin directory to see if it&#8217;s fixed. However, some plugin authors don&#8217;t do a very good job of informing users that a security patch has been applied.</p>\n<h2>WooCommerce and VaultPress</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce recently <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-2-3-11-patches-object-injection-vulnerability\">released an update</a> to fix an object injection vulnerability. If you look at the changelog for 2.3.11 which has the patch, there is no mention of a security vulnerability being fixed.</p>\n<h4>2.3.11 &#8211; 10/06/2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Check if rating is enabled before check if rating is required to a review.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; get_discounted_price needs to check if taxes are enabled.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Fixed filetype check for digital downloads.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Newfoundland and Labrador state rename.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Escaped js in widget layered nav when use the dropdown option.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Switch the permissions check for json_search_products to use the read_product capability.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Fixed the addition of variable products using the Order API.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Sale item exclusion logic for variations.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Clear correct variation stock transients when setting stock.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Switch to JSON to avoid unserializing untrusted data when handling responses from PayPal.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; API &#8211; Fixed the sanitization for downloadable files on products endpoint.</li>\n<li>Tweak &#8211; woocommerce_downloadable_file_exists filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To the untrained eye, 2.3.11 is just a regular maintenance release. Security fixes should be front and center and command attention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/vaultpress/changelog/\">VaultPress</a>, a security monitoring plugin by Automattic, also fails to provide clear information in its changelog. Determining security patches with VaultPress is confusing because security hotfixes are labeled as though they are patches for the plugin itself. Instead, security hotfixes are patches to protect from known security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4>1.7.5 &#8211; 11 Jun 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Add a new security hotfix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.4 &#8211; 28 Apr 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: Don&#8217;t allow openssl signing unless the public key exists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.3 &#8211; 27 Apr 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Add a new security hotfix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To add to the confusion, there&#8217;s no explanation as to what the hotfixes protect against. You have to read the <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1178685/vaultpress\">inline comment on GitHub</a> to know what the latest hotfix does.</p>\n<blockquote><p>// Protect WooCommerce from object injection via PayPal IPN notifications. Affects 2.0.20 -&gt; 2.3.10</p></blockquote>\n<p>If VaultPress developers added the comment from GitHub to the changelog on WordPress.org, it would have made things a lot clearer.</p>\n<h2>Users Read Change Logs</h2>\n<p>When we <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/poll-how-often-do-you-read-a-wordpress-plugins-changelog-before-updating\">asked readers</a> how often do they read a plugin&#8217;s changelog before updating, 705 out of 1,152 voters said they <strong>always</strong> read it while 338 people said they <strong>sometimes</strong> read it. Whether they understand the changes or not, users read change logs.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin developer, please consider adding context and clear explanations to your change logs. Clearly state what is a security patch, bug fix, or tweak. I don&#8217;t need to know the fine details, just enough information to make a good decision.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 19:12:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: HHVM Demonstrated to be 18.7% Faster Than PHP 7 on a WordPress Workload\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=45062\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"http://wptavern.com/hhvm-demonstrated-to-be-18-7-faster-than-php-7-on-a-wordpress-workload\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4072:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hhvmhack.png\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hhvmhack.png?resize=700%2C175\" alt=\"hhvmhack\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22751\" /></a></p>\n<p>This week HHVM developers shared the results of their first ever <a href=\"http://hhvm.com/blog/9293/lockdown-results-and-hhvm-performance\" target=\"_blank\">open source performance lockdown</a>. HHVM is Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hhvm\" target=\"_blank\">open source</a> PHP execution engine, originally created to help make its infrastructure more efficient. WordPress managed hosts, including <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-partners-with-10up-to-launch-enterprise-hhvm-wordpress-hosting-platform\" target=\"_blank\">WP Engine</a>, <a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/2014/06/run-hhvm-pagely/\" target=\"_blank\">Pagely</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/blog/hhvm/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteGround</a>, have added HHVM hosting options within the last year to cater to customers who require better PHP performance.</p>\n<p>During the HHVM team&#8217;s two week lockdown, developers focused on optimizing builtin functions, dynamic properties, string concatenation, and the file cache. The goal was to maximize requests per second (RPS) with WordPress, Drupal 7, and MediaWiki, using their <a href=\"https://github.com/hhvm/oss-performance\" target=\"_blank\">oss-performance</a> benchmarking tool.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During lockdown we achieved a 19.4% RPS improvement for MediaWiki workloads, and a 1.8% RPS improvement for WordPress,&#8221; Facebook developer Paul Bissonnette reported. &#8220;We demonstrated that HHVM is 55.5% faster than PHP 7 on a MediaWiki workload, <strong>18.7% faster on a WordPress workload</strong>, and 10.2% faster on a Drupal 7 workload.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These results were based on configuring each framework with a sample dataset designed to approximate an average installation. In order to create the WordPress workload, the HHVM team used URLs from the hhvm.com access logs to extract data.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hhvm.com/blog/9293/lockdown-results-and-hhvm-performance\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> contains a walkthrough of how the benchmarking tool works to approximate the maximum possible RPS of a server under a high load. Some of the most notable performance differences were summarized in the results of the engine comparison chart, which demonstrates the difference between PHP 5, PHP 7, and HHVM.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engine-comparison.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engine-comparison.png?resize=1025%2C429\" alt=\"engine-comparison\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45141\" /></a></p>\n<p>During the lockdown, the team also experimented with introducing asynchronous query execution to WordPress, the results of which the team plans to write about in the near future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As an exercise, we evaluated the benefits of <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/runtime/ext/async_mysql\" target=\"_blank\">async MySQL</a> in the WordPress environment. By modifying portions of WordPress to take advantage of the async capabilities offered by Hack and HHVM, we were able to examine the potential for performance gains through async execution. In our test environment we separated the MySQL and PHP hosting to separate machines within the same datacenter to approximate a realistic WordPress stack. The introduction of asynchronous query execution can demonstrate performance gains in both RPS and response time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see a more detailed report of the benefits they found from introducing async capabilities to WordPress. Overall, the lockdown provided an opportunity for collaboration across open source projects, resulting in a host of optimizations that will help OS frameworks perform better with HHVM in the future. The HHVM team plans to ship these improvements with the next release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 17:47:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"Matt: Paul Ford: What is Code? | Bloomberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45145\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/paul-ford-what-is-code-bloomberg/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:376:\"<blockquote><p>We are here because the editor of this magazine asked me, “Can you tell me what code is?”</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/\">Paul Ford&#8217;s amazing What is Code? for Bloomberg</a>.

The proposal is currently in the <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Definition&#8221; phase</a>, which means that participants are working to design the community by proposing hypothetical questions that embody the topic&#8217;s scope.</p>\n<p>So far for WooCommerce, popular hypothetical questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I handle the EU VATMOSS regulations in Woocommerce?</li>\n<li>How do I create an Order using WC REST API in my application?</li>\n<li>How to hide “add to cart” on free products?</li>\n<li>How to implement multiple versions of one digital product with different buyers&#8217; customizations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to move on to the next milestone, the site must have at least 40 questions that have a score of at least ten net votes (up minus down). The WooCommerce staging site needs the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 more followers</li>\n<li>33 more questions with a score of 10 or more</li>\n<li>People to max out upvoting quality questions already in the proposal (users can only vote 5 times)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StackExchange for general WordPress Development</a> is thriving with <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-stackexchange-thrives-in-2014-with-17-million-page-views-and-14k-new-questions\" target=\"_blank\">17 million page views and 14K new questions</a> in 2014. However, questions regarding third party plugins are considered off-topic and will be closed by moderators, hence the need for a separate WooCommerce Q&amp;A site.</p>\n<p>Alex Miller, one of the supporters of the WooCommerce StackExchange proposal, believes that the WooCommerce community needs a place where developers can quickly get answers to questions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WooCommerce Community Forums seemed like a decent place but was shut down months ago for unknown reasons,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My experience with the Woo Community Forums is that it was too broad and the upvote downvote system was poorly handled &#8211; good questions got buried too quickly with the large influx of new questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In contrast, the StackExchange model pushes questions that have activity (edits, comments, answers) to the top of the frontpage and lower quality questions (downvoted, flagged) receive less attention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a WooCommerce StackExchange site is also a great place for people with a great understanding of WooCommerce to document their knowledge for search engines to easily find,&#8221; Miller said. You can see an example of this by <a href=\"http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes\" target=\"_blank\">sorting the WPSE questions by votes</a> and reading the first few questions and answers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can only hope that with <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic&#8217;s acquisition of WooCommerce</a>, the forums will be reopened (WooCommunity forums have been shutdown for a few months now),&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;But either way I don&#8217;t think there is a much better platform than what the StackExchange offers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As StackExchange Q&amp;A sites are entirely community driven, WooCommerce community members who are interested in seeing it succeed are encouraged to <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/login?returnurl=%2fproposals%2f80132%2fwoocommerce%3ftab%3dvotes\" target=\"_blank\">log into StackExchange</a> and create/upvote quality questions that represent the community&#8217;s interests.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 21:23:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Customizer Typography: A Proof-of-Concept Plugin for WordPress Theme Authors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=45017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"http://wptavern.com/customizer-typography-a-proof-of-concept-plugin-for-wordpress-theme-authors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3644:\"<p>One option that users often appreciate in themes is the ability to control typography without having to modify any code. Justin Tadlock has been experimenting with <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2015/06/08/customizer-typography-project\" target=\"_blank\">adding a typography control class for the WordPress customizer</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of writing a lengthy tutorial, he opted to create a a proof-of-concept plugin that demonstrates how theme authors might accomplish this. <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/customizer-typography\" target=\"_blank\">Customizer Typography</a> is currently being developed on GitHub and Tadlock said it is &#8220;only meant for development purposes and to show one method of executing the idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customize-typography-screen.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customize-typography-screen.png?resize=1025%2C568\" alt=\"customize-typography-screen\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45019\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin was created to provide testing for two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing a customizer control class to handle typography</li>\n<li>Tying multiple customize settings to a single control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The most important was not having to add tons of code while still providing the developer complete control over each setting,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Fortunately, the Customization API in WordPress is pretty powerful and allows you to tie multiple settings to a single control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The plugin currently provides controls for live previewing both paragraph and headings with various font family, font weight, font style, font size, and line height options. <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/customizer-typography/blob/master/customize/control-typography.php#L207\" target=\"_blank\">Integrating Google Fonts</a> is on Tadlock&#8217;s to-do list, but at the moment he&#8217;s not working to build out the plugin as the ultimate solution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just to be clear, this is a proof of concept that I put together in an afternoon, not a polished solution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The idea, for me at least, would be to eventually extract it and put it into themes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I installed the plugin to play around with Twenty Fifteen and found that the experience of live previewing typography changes is very satisfying from a user standpoint. Although many custom theme options panels include basic typography controls, you often have to refresh the page to see how your changes applied. This kind of control is a prime candidate for integrating into the customizer.</p>\n<p>Tadlock&#8217;s example typography control class gives you a glimpse of what&#8217;s possible for theme authors who elect to build their options using the customizer. It&#8217;s these kinds of controls that truly solve a frustration and make it easier to personalize themes. The Customizer Typography plugin exemplifies the purpose of the customizer.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/customizer-typography\" target=\"_blank\">check out the plugin on GitHub</a> and install it to see the live previews in action. If you&#8217;re interested to learn more about building with the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/customizer-api/\" target=\"_blank\">Customizer API</a>, Tadlock published a post on the Make.WordPress.org/Themes blog that contains a long list of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/05/07/customizer-tutorials-and-documentation/\" target=\"_blank\">customizer tutorials and documentation</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 18:00:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 2.3.11 Patches Object Injection Vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=45099\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-2-3-11-patches-object-injection-vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:884:\"<p><a href=\"http://develop.woothemes.com/woocommerce/2015/06/woocommerce-2-3-11-security-and-maintenance-release/\">WooCommerce 2.3.11</a> patches an object injection vulnerability <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/06/security-advisory-object-injection-vulnerability-in-woocommerce.html\">discovered by Sucuri</a>.

If you use a WordPress plugin or theme that relies on prettyPhoto, please get in touch with the author to make sure they&#8217;re aware of this security vulnerability. If you use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/prettyphoto/\">prettyPhoto WordPress plugin</a>, make sure it&#8217;s running version 1.2 as it contains the patched library.</p>\n<h2>Risky Business</h2>\n<p>In 2011, <a title=\"http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2011/08/timthumb-2/\" href=\"http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2011/08/timthumb-2/\">TimThumb made headlines</a> when a major security vulnerability was discovered and used to hack into several websites. At the time, Ben Gillbanks, the library&#8217;s maintainer, estimated 95% of all commercial WordPress themes supported TimThumb.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2014, a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/100000-wordpress-sites-compromised-using-the-slider-revolution-security-vulnerability\">security vulnerability was discovered</a> in the Slider Revolution plugin that allowed more than 100k websites to be compromised.</p>\n<p>Using third-party scripts and libraries is not a bad thing. The practice however, comes with a set of risks. It&#8217;s up to developers to be vigilant and accept the responsibilities that come with relying on a third-party. It&#8217;s also imperative that developers do everything they can to update their products and users when a security vulnerability is discovered.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer, let us know the criteria in determining which third-party scripts, libraries, and tools you use.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 20:31:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"Post Status: Quick tip: Disconnect Jetpack from the WordPress.com side\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=12963\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://poststatus.com/quick-tip-disconnect-jetpack-from-the-wordpress-com-side/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2528:\"<p>About sixteen months ago, I wrote a post noting that it is <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/managing-jetpack-enabled-blogs-wordpress-com/\">really annoying to disconnect a WordPress.com account from a Jetpack install</a>. More annoying yet, is that you could not get rid of nonexistent Jetpack enabled websites from the WordPress.com &#8220;My Sites&#8221; section at all without contacting support.</p>\n<p>Over the years I collected quite a few Jetpack enabled websites connected to my WordPress.com username. Whether I was connecting a staging site or was too lazy to get a friend to setup their own account on WordPress.com, I ended up with a couple of dozen websites connected to my account that were not in my control.</p>\n<p>The traditional way to disconnect Jetpack from WordPress.com was via the site admin in the Jetpack settings. But over time, many of the sites I managed have went stagnant or completely offline, and there was no way to disconnect them anymore. But finally, you can disconnect Jetpack from the WordPress.com side.</p>\n<p>You can disconnect sites from the main &#8220;My Site&#8221; link (shown above) or the individual site (pictured below). Errored sites show up with a red warning side, and when you click the icon, the ability to permanently disconnect the site appears.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12965\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-com-disconnect-solo-752x385.png\" alt=\"wp-com-disconnect-solo\" width=\"752\" height=\"385\" /></p>\n<p>This has been a near daily annoyance of mine for years. I&#8217;m happy to see it finally get resolution. Special thanks to Automattician <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeherve/status/606369302216728576\">Jeremy Herve</a> for never forgetting about me.</p>\n<p>One more tip: if you go to your WordPress.com homepage often, and it doesn&#8217;t open up the page you want to be default for stats, you can set your default site under your <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/me/account\">account settings</a>. This is another annoyance of mine that I didn&#8217;t know had a solution until just now.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12966\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-com-account-752x377.jpg\" alt=\"wp-com-account\" width=\"752\" height=\"377\" /></p>\n<p>I know creating really effective user interfaces and account management tools is really hard. But attention to small details is awesome. I&#8217;m glad the WordPress.com team took care of this one, even if it took a while.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 18:18:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Matt: Peter Thiel on MBAs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45140\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/peter-thiel-on-mbas/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:877:\"<blockquote><p>I think one challenge a lot of the business schools have is they end up attracting students who are very extroverted and have very low conviction, and they put them in this hot house environment for a few years — at the end of which, a large number of people go into whatever was the last trendy thing to do. They’ve done studies at Harvard Business School where they’ve found that the largest cohort always went into the wrong field.

In it he clarified the reasons why he and several other core contributors are committed to iterating the customizer and identified the feature as a means of building user trust through live previews.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being able to make non-destructive changes and preview them is an important component of building that trust. This is perhaps most noticeable in the “save and surprise” approach of the widgets admin screen – every time you add a new widget, modify its settings, or move one around, the changes are saved and appear live on your site, even if you’re not ready yet. The customizer is our framework for live previewing changes. We are committed to providing live preview for all aspects of site customization and making it usable on all devices from phones to large screens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Boren briefly summarized the history of the customizer and alluded to a few possibilities the framework may offer in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The customizer has come a long way, but it still lacks some features and needs time to mature. We have many improvements planned and in progress, including transactions, partial refresh, theme installation, speedier loading, scaling to large screens, and possibly even integration with front end editing. Our live preview framework offers many possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Menu Customizer plugin was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-tentatively-approved-for-wordpress-4-3\" target=\"_blank\">tentatively approved for merge</a> during last week&#8217;s core development meeting. In order for the it to be officially approved for merge on June 17th, the plugin will need to meet the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/how-the-release-cycle-works/features-as-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">feature plugin criteria</a> outlined in the core handbook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have eight days to get the Menu Customizer plugin ready for merge,&#8221; Boren said. During this time the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/flow/\" target=\"_blank\">flow team</a> will be testing and documenting the flow and visuals for the menu customizer.</p>\n<p>Boren invited anyone who wants to contribute to this effort to create flow comparisons of the existing flow through Appearance > Menus versus flow through the customizer. This essentially involves walking through the experience of setting up menus, taking screenshots of the flow, and publishing them as a captioned gallery.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please help us capture the flows through Appearance > Menus used by you and your clients,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need this information to ensure our new interfaces are mindful and aware of how WordPress is actually used.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Anyone can contribute to WordPress in this way, as it doesn&#8217;t require any coding. The core team is looking for people to capture real user scenarios to help in making the final decision.</p>\n<h3>There is No Timeline for Removing the Appearance > Menus Screen</h3>\n<p>In the original <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/03/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-menu-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">merge proposal</a> for the Menu Customizer the plugin&#8217;s author, Nick Halsey, outlined what he called a &#8220;fairly aggressive&#8221; plan for the removal of the old menus admin screen. As contributor resources are scarce when it comes to the Menus component, Halsey favored focusing all new development on the UI in the customizer.</p>\n<p>The timeline he outlined was for WordPress 4.3 to point the Menus link in the admin bar to Menus in the customizer and later releases (WordPress 4.5 or 4.6) would remove all core links to the Menus admin screen.</p>\n<p>WordPress users reacted strongly to this aggressive timeline for removing the old menus screen, but the timeline was merely a suggestion as part of the proposal. Halsey was not keen on merging the plugin without a definitive timeline for removing the old menus, a factor which he considered a &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1433384682001602\" target=\"_blank\">dealbreaker</a>&#8221; for merge.</p>\n<p>However, WordPress 4.3 release lead Konstantin Obenland confirmed that no official timeline has been set.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pollyplummer\">@pollyplummer</a> There is no timeline either way.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Konstantin Obenland (@obenland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obenland/status/608377778933743616\">June 9, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ryan Boren also confirmed that WordPress will continue to maintain the Appearance > Menus screen should the plugin be officially approved for merge in the coming days:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the Appearance screens will remain and will be maintained. Appearance > Menus recently received some attention in the form of a few fixes. More attention is needed and will be given. There are still differences in the flows each approach best enables, whether it’s new site/theme setup, small maintenance tasks, or dedicated content managers for heavy usage of widgets, menus, or other pieces of content that benefit from having a preview mechanism. We should gather quantifiable metrics when it comes to performance and time to completion for a given flow, as well as evaluating the less-objectively-quantifiable perceived performance. <strong>There may come a time where the worlds converge; however, that time is not now.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This confirmation should assuage those whose opposition to the Menu Customizer was solely based on the aggressive timeline proposed for removing the old menus screen.</p>\n<p>The great divide on the Menu Customizer revolves around one aspect of improvement that Boren mentioned in his paragraph about the future of the customizer: <strong>scaling to large screens</strong>. The vast majority of WordPress users and developers who are following this debate are those who would be more likely to configure a menu in a desktop environment and not via mobile (where the customizer is currently designed to shine).</p>\n<p>Many who oppose the merge of the plugin have identified the cramped UI as the primary reason that it does not provide a better experience for users. You would be hard pressed to find anyone who is opposed to live previews or better usability on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Those who manage WordPress sites via desktop are not willing to sacrifice the old menus screen for a new UI that currently caters primarily to smaller devices. Until the Menu Customizer can adequately provide a UI that fully adapts to all screen sizes, resistance to the feature is likely to continue.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 22:34:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: Trust but Preview\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45138\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/trust-but-preview/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:273:\"<p>If you&#8217;re following along with the customizer and menu work for the next version of WordPress, check out <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/\">Trust, Live Preview, and Menus in the Customizer</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Jun 2015 20:00:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WPTavern: Introducing the WP Tavern Wapuu\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44960\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://wptavern.com/introducing-the-wp-tavern-wapuu\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6761:\"<p>The <a href=\"http://wapuu.jp/\">Wapuu craze</a> has spread far and wide.

She doesn&#8217;t plan on writing tutorials to modify the base Wapuu. Instead, she is creating <a href=\"https://github.com/marktimemedia/my-wapuu\">a base Wapuu</a> that will have separated pieces so its easier to modify.</p>\n<p>She often sketches and re-draws Wapuus that are not in their normal position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, most of the Wapuus are slightly modified to make it easier for them to hold or interact with their elements. I thought of him like a cartoon character (fluid) more so than a logo or icon (rigid),&#8221; Schulp told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Schulp has always had an interest in sketching cartoons. For WordCamp Miami 2015, she created a variety of custom-made My Little Pony stickers.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MyLittlePonyStickers.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-44978 size-large\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MyLittlePonyStickers.jpg?resize=309%2C500\" alt=\"My Little Pony Stickers\" /></a>My Little Pony Stickers\n<p>She also uses her skills to create <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/marktimemedia/developer-collaboration\">unique slide decks</a> filled with colorful illustrations.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CustomSlideDeck.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-44983 size-large\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CustomSlideDeck.png?resize=500%2C415\" alt=\"Custom Slide Deck\" /></a>Custom Slide Deck\n<h2>From WordCamps to Websites and Eventually Companies</h2>\n<p>Wapuu is considered the official mascot character of WordPress and was designed by Kazuko Kaneuchi in 2011. It’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jawordpressorg/wapuu\" target=\"_blank\">distributed under the GPLv2 or later</a> and can be modified by anyone. The character is used to represent different cultures and regions of the world.</p>\n<p>Now that Wapuu is showing up as a mascot for sites that focus on WordPress, the question is, when will it be used to represent companies in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n<p>Shortly after <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce\">Automattic acquired WooThemes</a>, Nick Hamze was criticized on the Advanced WordPress Facebook group for creating a <a href=\"http://blog.nickhamze.com/2015/05/19/hiro-wapuu-bffs/\">Wapuu dressed up like a ninja</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If the graphic was created by WooThemes and independently of the acquisition I&#8217;d think oh cute, WooTheme&#8217;s mascot is teaching WordPress&#8217; mascot how to be a ninja, best friends forever for sure.</p>\n<p>Instead, it came from an Automattician and in the context of Automattic acquiring WooThemes, to me it reads that Automattic is using Wapuu, which just bugs me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At WordCamp Miami 2015, Rocketgenius came under fire for creating swag that features Wapuu wearing a space suit with a rocket patch on its arm.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock\">@carlhancock</a> Wapuu is for promoting WordPress. It promotes a open source project and not a company.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Marko Heijnen (@markoheijnen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markoheijnen/status/605072873586356224\">May 31, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is what the swag looks like. The logo is subtle in nature and if you didn&#8217;t already know it represents Rocketgenius, it would fit naturally into the design.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SpaceWapuu.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-44989 size-large\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SpaceWapuu.jpg?resize=375%2C500\" alt=\"Space Wapuu With Rocket Patch\" /></a>Space Wapuu With Rocket Patch\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there are no rules in how Wapuu can be used. The only guideline is maintaining Kaneuchi&#8217;s copyright.

Unlike the WordPress logo, which is trademarked, Wapuu is free of such restrictions meaning anyone can use it for anything, including commercial endeavors.</p>\n<p>The community needs to protect Wapuu from enterprises that want to claim it as their own. We must respect its origins and give credit where credit is due.

This venue has a maximum capacity of 60 people, so tickets are likely to sell out fast.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress lead developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgibbs\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Gibbs</a> and contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karmatosed\" target=\"_blank\">Tammie Lister</a> are teaming up to organize the event and put out the <a href=\"http://brighton.buddycamp.org/2015/call-for-speakers/\" target=\"_blank\">call for speakers</a> and <a href=\"http://brighton.buddycamp.org/2015/call-for-sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsors</a> today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The really exciting thing is that this is going to be the first BuddyCamp outside North America/Canada &#8211; the first in Europe,&#8221; Gibbs said. &#8220;From my role in the BuddyPress project, I know we have many fans across the continent, and it&#8217;s those people we want to come to BuddyCamp, so we&#8217;re going to focus on making the event as accessible as possible for all those visitors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brighton has a thriving <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WordUp-Brighton/\" target=\"_blank\">local WordPress community</a> and BuddyPress interest runs deep throughout the UK, making it a strategic location for hosting Europe&#8217;s first BuddyCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Brighton itself has a great tech community, as does London obviously (which is just over an hour away on train), so there&#8217;s a lot of potential,&#8221; Gibbs said.</p>\n<p>Organizers are hoping to receive a wide range of presentation subjects from potential speakers, including both beginner and technical topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty keen on beginners content, mixed with a range of showcases and great examples of the potential of BuddyPress,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Gibbs confirmed that peripheral bbPress topics are also welcome among speaker submissions, even though the event will focus primarily on BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a lot of overlap, especially around community management and development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;d be happy to receive talk proposals in these areas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>BuddyCamp Brighton is a historic event for the European BuddyPress community and will be formatted as an intimate gathering where attendees of all skill levels are welcome. BuddyPress enthusiasts will learn more about the varied uses of the plugin and will also have the opportunity to get connected to core contributors in the region.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people go home happy and inspired to use BuddyPress to help them grow a community, then I&#8217;ll be very happy,&#8221; Gibbs said.</p>\n<p>Those interested to attend can <a href=\"http://brighton.buddycamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to email updates</a> or follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuddyCampUK\" target=\"_blank\">@BuddyCampUK</a> on Twitter to be notified when tickets go on sale.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jun 2015 22:06:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Seeks Feedback on the Review Process, Themes, and the Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44912\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-feedback-on-the-review-process-themes-and-the-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5390:\"<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/survey.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/survey.jpg?resize=1025%2C507\" alt=\"photo credit: Lukasz Kowalewski\" class=\"size-full wp-image-44957\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/FI3UYVGNFD\">Lukasz Kowalewski</a>\n<p>The WordPress Theme Review Team (TRT) is currently seeking feedback via three separate surveys on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-review-process-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">review process</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-usability-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">themes</a>, and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-directory-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">directory</a>. After weathering several months of increasingly negative community feedback, the team is now looking to users and theme authors to help shape its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> for the future.</p>\n<p>The team&#8217;s controversial decision to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options\" target=\"_blank\">require theme authors to use the customizer for building theme options</a> ignited a heated debate, which continued as more guidelines came up for consideration. Community members expressed concern that more rules and regulations might limit the future of WordPress themes. The conversation surrounding violations of the &#8220;<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-is-cracking-down-on-violations-of-the-presentation-vs-functionality-guideline\" target=\"_blank\">Presentation vs. Functionality</a>&#8221; guideline contributed to the team&#8217;s decision to reevaluate the general direction of the official directory and the process of getting a theme approved.</p>\n<p>Following a brainstorming session with Matt Mullenweg on May 28th, the TRT decided to step back and look at the process and the directory in a new way. This opened up many new avenues for the team to explore, and the three user surveys are a response to the new direction.</p>\n<p>TRT member Tammie Lister opened up the feedback channels with an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-directory-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">overview</a> of the purpose behind the surveys:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a part of our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Directory Roadmap</a>, we are going to be taking a good look at every aspect of the theme submission, review, and browsing experience on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>To kick off the research phase of our roadmap, we’re issuing a series of surveys targeting theme authors, theme reviewers, and WordPress users. In addition to surveying users, we’ll also be analyzing other theme directories on the web, and reviewing other theme submission processes to see what we can bring back to WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-usability-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">Usability survey</a> is an opportunity for anyone who has ever used a WordPress.org-hosted theme to voice an opinion on that experience. The survey briefly touches on whether the user views a demo before downloading the theme. The quality of theme demos is currently a hot topic of discussion, as many believe that the current demos are woefully inadequate at showing a theme&#8217;s potential.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-review-process-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Process survey</a> is specifically for theme authors and includes open-ended questions regarding the process and obstacles to getting a theme launched.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://13233232.polldaddy.com/s/what-is-it-like-to-have-your-theme-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\">Finding a WordPress Theme</a> survey concerns the directory, but it is the most limited in scope. The survey includes just one question about where users look for a theme when starting a new site.</p>\n<p>One WordPress theme developer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/theme-directory-survey/#comment-41962\" target=\"_blank\">commented on the survey</a>, suggesting a few more detailed questions that could be helpful, but Lister indicated that the TRT is examining the first round of responses before moving on to further research.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this stage we should not get into too much detail as we want to get an over-view. We also have some stats we can use in conjunction. This is not something we’re going to change format wise this time around.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The three surveys are a unique opportunity for users to voice their opinions on the experience of using WordPress.org themes, and take just minutes to complete. Hopefully, when the next stage of research is launched they will survey users on more specific concerns.</p>\n<p>The TRT&#8217;s request for feedback marks the beginning of a radical shift in the direction of the team. Instead of instituting more guidelines, TRT is looking at better ways to encourage creativity among theme authors and improve the process of submitting themes.

When we look at rockstars in the WordPress community, we typically look at developers, designers, and marketers. Little is known about the documentation writers out there who shed their blood, sweat, and tears to ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>\n<p>This post is about those who day in, and day out stare at endless lines of code to decipher what the developer was thinking, and the true meaning behind the code that exists.</p>\n<h2>Good Documentation is More Than Words</h2>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationWords.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44914\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationWords.png\" alt=\"Documentation Words\" width=\"730\" height=\"295\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/80719942@N00/4733367729\">Variatie &#8211; Tekst</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Good documentation writers provide more than an instruction manual, they provide an experience. I have known excellent documenters, coached beginners, and the largest difference between them is understanding the brain of those reading it. Just like a novel, documentation has a flow that keeps the reader interested and ingesting more information than they realize.</p>\n<p>Quality documentation targets the users that are most likely to read it. It also provides a point of reference for those who are more unlikely to read it. For example, if documenting a particular hook, it’s typically assumed that a developer will be reading it, but what about those who have little development experience?</p>\n<p>A good documentation writer will provide a point of reference for those who need more of a push in the right direction, without the need to contact support to spell it out for them.</p>\n<h2>Documentation Has a Larger Impact Than You Think</h2>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ImpactImage.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44916\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ImpactImage.png\" alt=\"Impact Image\" width=\"585\" height=\"298\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/24113168@N03/3891599149\">Eruption</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Most simply ignore documentation, pushing it off into the endless abyss until they can’t take it anymore. I’m guilty of the same thing in some cases. What those people don’t realize, is that every moment their plugin or theme is left undocumented, user experience suffers.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at your most common support ticket. If you better documented that issue, would those tickets go away entirely? Probably not. Would you get fewer tickets regarding the issue as well as increase you or your support agent&#8217;s productivity? I guarantee it. I think we could all use fewer support tickets.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned previously, documentation makes a dramatic impact on user experience. If the user is able to locate the information easily and efficiently, they have saved their own time as well as yours. The average world life expectancy is 66.57 years and your users would rather be doing something else with their lives than fiddling around with poorly written documentation.</p>\n<p>If a customer sees that you have put quite a bit of time and effort into your documentation, they will, whether consciously or not, better appreciate you. Good documentation shows you care about them after the initial sale.</p>\n<p>Have you ever been left high and dry after spending hard-earned money and soon regretted the purchase? I think we all have. With proper documentation, you can avoid passing that feeling off to your customers.</p>\n<h2>How Can You Write Better Documentation?</h2>\n<p>The first step is to stop avoiding it. Once you&#8217;re good at it, writing documentation is more of a pleasurable experience than you think. In fact, it will become second nature. Just like everything else in the world, practice makes perfect.</p>\n<p>One of the first steps you want to take when deciding to take your documentation to the next level is to determine your pain points. What are you being contacted about? If you start blindly writing about things, you may find that what you’re writing about isn’t making as much of an impact you would like it to.</p>\n<p>One of the best techniques I have discovered is to track the number of tickets that are documented vs. those that are not, and break those that are not into categories. This way, you can better target your pain points, and revise the parts that may not be as helpful as they should be.</p>\n<p>After you have determined what documentation you should write, you should determine your target audience, and break it down into developers, users, and power users. This helps you cater to that particular audience. We’ll go over how to target those users a bit later.</p>\n<p>Next, you want to break down the document. For developers, you’ll want to break it down into raw information (accepted arguments, return values, etc.), specific examples and use-cases. For users, the best course of action is a walkthrough. Every step they will need to take, regardless of how trivial it may seem, is critical.</p>\n<p>Spell it out to them every step of the way. Documenting for power users is very similar to a user scenario, but more structured and scannable. Be clear, but allow them to easily jump to where they need to go without reading the previous step first.</p>\n<h2>The Art of Writing Better Documentation</h2>\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationArt.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44917\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DocumentationArt.png\" alt=\"Documentation Art\" width=\"497\" height=\"249\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41455403@N00/458033123\">Space invader. Paris. Gare de lyon</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>When it comes to the art of writing your documentation, write in a way that best targets your audience, but also use simple language that you know they will understand. One of the best reasons for this is due to translations. While Google translate does an excellent job, it’s much easier to translate the simple vocabulary of a 5th grader than that contained within a post-grad thesis.</p>\n<p>Within your content, don’t be afraid to link to relevant content. This will allow you to avoid repeating yourself through multiple documents, as well as allow the reader to back-track if they need more information about a particular subject. After all, your main goals are to make the user happy, and save yourself time.</p>\n<p>The documentation process doesn’t stop after you press the <strong>publish</strong> button. Go back and revise every document as needed. Almost immediately after the document is published, go back and see if the support tickets you tracked have declined, and traffic to that particular article has increased. Usually, if you’re getting more traffic to an article, it’s helping. If you’re getting more traffic but the same number of support tickets, you may want to look into that article to see why.</p>\n<h2>What We Have Learned</h2>\n<p>First, I hope that after making it this far, you have a better appreciation for those in the trenches writing the documentation that most of us take for granted. It truly is an art form that many of us who write documentation for a living truly enjoy and put many, many hours into.</p>\n<p>I also hope that you come away from this article thinking more about your existing documentation and how it can be improved. Proper documentation can be extremely rewarding and once in practice, can actually be quite fun to write.</p>\n<p>Document early, document often.

It provides a BP core-supported method of managing user-submitted files and opens up a world of possibilities for plugin developers.</p>\n<p>The API powers the new avatar uploads UI, but it can also be used to extend BuddyPress to add media sharing capabilities. If you want to see a good example of this in the wild, check out BuddyDrive version <a href=\"https://github.com/imath/buddydrive/tree/1.3\" target=\"_blank\">1.3.0</a>. The plugin was created by BP core developer <a href=\"http://imathi.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu Viet</a>, who led the effort to get the BP Attachments API into the latest release.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddydrive/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyDrive</a> allows members to share a file or a list of files with the community and includes various settings for restricting access. It&#8217;s essentially like a Dropbox clone for BuddyPress, designed to enhance collaboration between members. The plugin was a prime candidate for adapting the BP Attachments API to power community file sharing in a simpler, more elegant way.</p>\n<p>You can see it active in the new &#8220;BuddyDrive Editor&#8221; included in version 1.3, demonstrated in the video below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Viet posted an <a href=\"https://github.com/imath/buddydrive/wiki/The-BuddyDrive-Editor\" target=\"_blank\">example function</a> in the plugin&#8217;s wiki to show how the BuddyDrive Editor can be placed anywhere. The feature is a good example of how easy it is for developers to leverage the API to manage user-generated media from the frontend.</p>\n<p>BuddyDrive 1.3 is currently in beta and on track to be released soon. If you&#8217;d like to help test the beta or inspect the code to see how it works, you can download a zip file from Viet&#8217;s <a href=\"http://imathi.eu/2015/06/02/buddydrive-1-3-0/\" target=\"_blank\">preview post</a>. The unreleased <a href=\"https://github.com/imath/buddydrive/tree/1.3\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.3</a> is also available on GitHub.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about using the new BP Attachments API, check out Viet&#8217;s comprehensive <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/plugindev/bp_attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">BP codex article</a>. It walks you through extending the <code>BP_Attachment</code> class to validate and store files in a subdirectory of wp-content/uploads. The documentation also includes a sample plugin to demonstrate how you might add attachments to private messages.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Jun 2015 04:20:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: How to Add a Default Image to Jetpack’s Related Posts Module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44865\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-add-a-default-image-to-jetpacks-related-posts-module\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2712:\"<p>Jetpack&#8217;s related posts module is a great way to show related content without using the same server resources used to host a site.

All official EDD themes (those that are built by the EDD core team) are now 100% free. This includes half a dozen themes that are guaranteed to be fully compatible with EDD, including the new <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/vendd/\" target=\"_blank\">Vendd</a> theme launching today.</p>\n<p>EDD support manager Sean Davis clarified how the free themes will be supported:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Official EDD themes are available to you at absolutely no cost. They will still be licensed so that you can receive theme updates directly from your WordPress dashboard and we will also provide support. The only thing changing is the price.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Responding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nphaskins/status/606478597851746304\" target=\"_blank\">criticism</a> on Twitter saying that the change contributes to the <a href=\"https://philiparthurmoore.com/ruining-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">undervaluation of WordPress themes</a>, EDD founder <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pippin Williamson</a> said, &#8220;For us it&#8217;s not about the themes. It&#8217;s about the entire package. By making it easy for users to have a good shop up and running in minutes, we significantly increase the potential value to that customer and of that customer. We also dramatically reduce the cost of support by having more users on more reliable themes that are built for EDD.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Making half a dozen themes free might seem like it would significantly increase EDD&#8217;s support burden, but Williamson expects that the move will pay off in other ways. Like many other WordPress business owners who have made some of their best work free, Williamson has a strategy for how it will work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The change lowers the barrier to entry,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;When the barrier is lowered, the user base grows. When the user base grows, the customer base grows. From a business side, we will have far more success converting free users to paid customers after they&#8217;ve already been given a great experience with a theme.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nphaskins\">@nphaskins</a> Not sugar coating it at all.

The core product(s) are free and satisfied users go on to make purchases from the <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">add-ons marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By setting them up with a good theme from the get go, the likelihood that they become a paying customer is substantially higher,&#8221; Williamson said.</p>\n<p>So far, the freemium model has worked well for the company and making six theme products free makes sense when the business primarily revolves around plugins.

Last year, he <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-state-of-the-word-highlights-internationalization-mobile-and-new-tools-for-wordpress-contributors\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the the event had outgrown the Mission Bay venue and that it would be expanding to become WordCamp US in 2015.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Touch the walls as you walk out, as this is the last time we\'ll have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampSF?src=hash\">#WordCampSF</a> here! ~ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcsf14?src=hash\">#wcsf14</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/endofanera?src=hash\">#endofanera</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp SF (@WordCampSF) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampSF/status/526454529584549889\">October 26, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The decision to seek a new venue in a new city was partly based on the need to make room for more attendees and presentations. Another benefit of moving the event out of San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world, is that it will likely become more accessible to a greater number of people.</p>\n<p>WordCamp US will follow a format similar to WordCamp Europe in that it will be held in a rotating city. The city has not yet been selected, which is surprising given that the year is nearly halfway finished.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg put out <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/wordcamp-us-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">a call for host city applications</a> on his blog and linked to a <a href=\"http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/apply-to-host-wordcamp-us\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> where candidates can apply.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of cities out there that might be an excellent fit for WordCamp US, but many are lacking a vibrant local WordPress community to help support the event. While this is not stated as an explicit requirement, it would be difficult to pull off such a large event without an army of local volunteers.</p>\n<p>WordPress is aiming big for its first ever WordCamp US. The survey states that host city applicants must secure a venue with hotels within three miles that can support 1,500 &#8211; 2,000 attendees. Potential organizers must supply average hotel costs for a range of budgets and average flight costs from the West Coast, East Coast, Midwest, Mexico, and Canada.</p>\n<p>Hosting the event will be a massive undertaking that will require an organization team capable of putting everything together in a very short amount of time. Events of this size normally have the benefit of longer planning periods. For example, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/applications-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2016-closing-soon\" target=\"_blank\">applications to host WordCamp Europe 2016 closed two months ago</a> and the team is already training volunteers for next year&#8217;s event.</p>\n<p>If your team is up to the challenge of hosting WordCamp US, you&#8217;ll need to be prepared to submit venue information with room capacities, a detailed event budget, potential dates, and contributor day options. So far, Mullenweg has received in-person pitches for Phoenix but the application process is open to teams from any city. When <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/where-will-wordcamp-usa-be-held\" target=\"_blank\">WP Tavern readers were surveyed seven months ago</a>, commenters favored Chicago, Las Vegas, Kansas City, Houston, and Dallas.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Jun 2015 04:58:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: Unsubscribing from Newsletters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45117\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://ma.tt/2015/06/unsubscribing-from-newsletters/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2593:\"<p>When <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/04/trying-gmail/\">Gmail first came out I got on pretty early and procured what I thought was a cool email address</a>, mmmmmm@gmail.com. That&#8217;s because matt@ was too short, and matthew@ was taken. Ask anyone with a &#8220;cool&#8221; email address on a major service or Twitter handle and you&#8217;ll mostly hear about what a pain it is constantly getting spam, other people&#8217;s email, and people trying to log in to your account. These days it seems that address is used mostly by people forced to put something into an email form at places they don&#8217;t want to, so constant mail from mortgage places, car dealerships, porn sites, and countless email newsletters. I never ended up using the account for anything myself besides normal Google stuff.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a service to help you unsubscribe from things <a href=\"https://unroll.me/\">called Unroll.me</a> which is pretty neat, and it&#8217;ll scan your account to find all of the newsletters and things you can unsubscribe from, and gives you a one-click interface to do so. Unfortunately if you had over 5,000 &#8220;subscriptions&#8221; as I had, that becomes a 5,000 click operation and they provide no bulk tools, and apparently no plans to add them:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt\">@photomatt</a> unfortunately there\'s no mass unsubscribe option at this time, though  we are seriously considering it for the future!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Unroll.Me (@Unrollme) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Unrollme/status/595680719495634949\">May 5, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>I assume this is because they want people to add newsletters to their digest service instead of just unsubscribing. Code to the rescue! Written by the <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/coffee2code\">inimitable Scott Reilly</a>. After you sign up and sign in, go <a href=\"https://unroll.me/rollup/edit/new\">to this page</a>, go to the javascript console (in Chrome: View → Developer → Javascript Console), then copy and paste the below code and press enter.</p>\n.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; }\n<p></p>\n<p>Then sit back and wait, it&#8217;s set so every 1.5 seconds it clicks an unsubscribe link. I do this about once a week now since I can accumulate 20-100 new subscriptions in that time. This code will break if they change anything, but should be pretty easy to update when they do. It currently shows me as unsubscribed from 7,868 things! If there was a way to pay for my account on Unroll.me I would do so happily.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Jun 2015 02:23:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3 “Livio” Released, Features the New BP Attachments API\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44666\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-livio-released-features-the-new-bp-attachments-api\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4503:\"<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/chez-livio.jpg\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/chez-livio.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: Chez Livio on TripAdvisor.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"348\" class=\"size-full wp-image-44799\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g196581-d714980-Reviews-Chez_Livio-Neuilly_sur_Seine_Hauts_de_Seine_Ile_de_France.html#photos\">Chez Livio on TripAdvisor.com</a>\n<p>BuddyPress 2.3 &#8220;Livio&#8221; was released today, named in honor of <a href=\"http://www.chezlivio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chez Livio</a>, a famous Italian restaurant and pizza joint in Paris. Development on the 2.3 release cycle began in March with contributors <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-development-kicks-off-contributors-prioritize-work-on-new-apis\" target=\"_blank\">prioritizing work on new APIs</a> alongside improvements to BuddyPress&#8217; existing APIs. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of what&#8217;s new:</p>\n<h4>BP Attachments API</h4>\n<p>The highlight of this release is the <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/plugindev/bp_attachment/\" target=\"_blank\">BP Attachments API</a>, a new library that enables developers to create components that have the ability to manage uploads. You can see it in action in the greatly <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-will-improve-avatar-uploads-with-the-new-bp-attachments-api\" target=\"_blank\">improved avatar uploads UI</a>, which now supports drag-and-drop uploads and includes mobile integration with phone/tablet/laptop cameras.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/avatar-ui.gif\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/avatar-ui.gif\" alt=\"avatar-ui\" width=\"657\" height=\"355\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44742\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Companion Stylesheets for WordPress Default Themes</h4>\n<p>If you want to test BuddyPress and you&#8217;re not sure which theme to use, check out one of WordPress&#8217; most recent default themes. Version 2.3 of the plugin ships with <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-will-introduce-companion-stylesheets-for-wordpress-default-themes\" target=\"_blank\">companion stylesheets</a> for Twenty Fourteen and Twenty Fifteen, which tidy up the appearance of BuddyPress components and UI elements when the default themes are active. The stylesheets also introduce vertical menus that eliminate the crowding often seen in the horizontal user/group navigation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-user-account-nav.png\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bp-user-account-nav.png\" alt=\"bp-user-account-nav\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1004\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43323\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Better Excerpts for Blog Post Activity</h4>\n<p>Version 2.3 has better support for blog post activity items. If the Site Tracking component is activated, BuddyPress will now display better excerpts in the activity stream for posts containing images or other embedded media. This improvement pairs nicely with the custom post type support that was added to the activity stream in the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-spumoni-released-featuring-new-member-type-api\" target=\"_blank\">2.2. release</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/activity-stream-blog-post.jpg\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/activity-stream-blog-post.jpg\" alt=\"activity-stream-blog-post\" width=\"616\" height=\"443\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44744\" /></a></p>\n<p>Other highlights in BuddyPress 2.3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Member Type Directories</strong> – Create directories of member types on your site using the <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/member-types/\" target=\"_blank\">Member Type API</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Star Private Messages</strong> – Mark important messages in your inbox with a star.</li>\n<li><strong>Notification Meta</strong> – Notifications are now more extensible with an additional metadata table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall this release offers an excellent balance between new features and improvements upon existing features, which combine to make BuddyPress more extensible and more enjoyable to use. It includes hundreds of bug fixes and enhancements from 40 volunteer contributors.

Nick Halsey posted the Customizer Team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/03/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-menu-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> last night, beginning with a summary of the purpose of moving menu management into the customizer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the process, we hope to offer an updated design with improved user flow, a mobile-first interface, improved accessibility, rebuild the administration UI from the ground up to be JavaScript-driven, solve long-standing problems with the current implementation, and clarify the purposes and capabilities of the menus feature. Additionally, Menu Customizer contributes significantly to the long-term goal to move all appearance functionality and, really, everything that could benefit from live previewing, from the admin to the Customizer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Menu management in the customizer is essentially a full replacement of all the capabilities previously housed in the admin. It allows for editing, reordering, deleting, and adding individual menu items within any menu. The plugin adds a convenient global search that includes all post types, terms, and taxonomies.</p>\n<p>The video below was prepared by Halsey&#8217;s team to demonstrate the capabilities of the Menu Customizer:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The dizzying speed with which she flips between panels in the demo is not representative of the capabilities of your average WordPress user. Given that the plugin currently requires WordPress 4.3 alpha, it&#8217;s not likely that it has not been widely tested by users of varying experience levels.</p>\n<p>My initial impression after testing is that managing menus in the customizer makes me feel claustrophobic. The live previews and the mobile friendliness are the big wins here, but they come at the expense of a squished menu management experience. For sites that use WordPress as a CMS, with dozens and sometimes hundreds of pages and subpages, menu management in the customizer could become rather cumbersome.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/menu-customizer-test-add-page.jpg\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/menu-customizer-test-add-page.jpg\" alt=\"menu-customizer-test-add-page\" width=\"848\" height=\"644\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44768\" /></a></p>\n<p>I have no doubt that the Menu Customizer has been architected to perform better as a JavaScript-driven solution for managing menus. Halsey and the team employed no small amount of wizardry in creating the custom panel for implementing screen options and the sections that lazy load menu items.</p>\n<p>But if you put a relatively new WordPress user in front of the customizer menu panel, will it be intuitive to use?  Will stuffing menus into the customizer cause the usability of the feature to decline?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/962590793803135/\" target=\"_blank\">Reactions to the proposal</a> in the Advanced WordPress Facebook group were less than enthusiastic, as not many favor expanding the customizer&#8217;s reach into menu management.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t feel the Customizer is the correct place to <em>manage</em> menus or any content for that matter,&#8221; member Tom Hemsley commented. &#8220;If a theme offers <em>styling</em> options for a menu then fair enough &#8211; put those styling options in the customizer. But the customizer is not the place for managing content. Why not force people to create new posts using the Customizer, too?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lisa League&#8217;s comment accurately summarizes many others&#8217; initial reactions to the demo video: &#8220;My first impression of Make was not &#8216;Cool, look how they did this with the customizer&#8217; but &#8216;Whoa, there&#8217;s too much stuff in this tiny space.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Menu Customizer plugin is approved to merge into core, Halsey outlined a plan for the removal of the old menu admin screen in favor of focusing all new development on the UI in the customizer. WordPress 4.3 would point the Menus link in the admin bar to Menus in the customizer and later releases would remove all core links to the Menus admin screen, or point them to the customizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The above plan is fairly aggressive, to eliminate any ambiguity about future plans and intentions and to avoid the potential for mass trac ticket rot,&#8221; Halsey said.</p>\n<p>WordPress cannot move forward without making changes and taking risks. The question of whether or not to merge the Menu Customizer plugin should inspire some fairly active discussion in the days ahead. If you want to test the plugin for yourself, the easiest way is to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin to get 4.3-alpha running and then install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-customizer\" target=\"_blank\">Menu Customizer</a> from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Core contributors will discuss the Menu Customizer proposal today during the regularly scheduled development meeting on Slack. According to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 4.3 project schedule</a>, the feature plugin merge window will close June 17th and the official release is expected in mid-August.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jun 2015 18:15:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Steven Gliebe Launches WordPress Commercial Plugin Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44649\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://wptavern.com/steven-gliebe-launches-wordpress-commercial-plugin-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6532:\"<p>More than 38k plugins are available for free on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugin directory</a>. While the theme directory has a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/commercial/\">category for commercial themes</a>, the plugin directory does not.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/interview-matt-mullenweg/\">Matt Medeiros interviewed Matt Mullenweg</a> earlier this year and asked if the plugin directory could turn into something similar to an app store, Mullenweg replied that the plugin directory will not turn into a market place or an app store and will never host commercial plugins. Outside of <a href=\"http://codecanyon.net/\">CodeCanyon</a>, I&#8217;m not aware of any WordPress plugin directory that focuses on commercial plugins.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Pro Plugin Directory</h2>\n<p>Steven Gliebe who <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hostingreviews-io-webhosting-reviews-without-the-affliate-links\">runs HostingReviews.io</a> and is the founder of <a title=\"http://churchthemes.com/\" href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">Churchthemes.com</a> has launched the<a href=\"https://proplugindirectory.com/2015/05/30/launching/\"> Pro Plugin Directory</a>. The site lists commercial plugins from a variety of categories including, forms, performance, and security. Its design is based on a modified child theme of <a href=\"https://array.is/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/\">Checkout by ArrayHQ</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ProPluginDirectory.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44750\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ProPluginDirectory.png?resize=960%2C609\" alt=\"Pro Plugin Directory Home Page\" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Home Page\n<p>Gliebe created the site because he was frustrated that there was no resource for easily locating commercial WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of the time I do find what I need in the free directory. Sometimes though, I want to see what the commercial options are,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>After asking several members of the community if such a site already exists, he came up empty. &#8220;I asked around and found that apparently there is no definitive <em>Pro</em> plugin directory as I suspected, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a go. WordPress is 12 years old and it&#8217;s beyond time to establish this.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Monetization Strategy</h2>\n<p>Maintaining a directory can be hard work and without a way to be paid for the effort involved, interest can disappear quickly. Affiliate links are a natural strategy for the site while another is to sell upgraded listings.</p>\n<p>His focus is getting the site established with as many listings as possible. &#8220;Right now, my focus is on building up the site and making it useful. If it proves to be successful in that respect then I&#8217;m sure there will be a reasonable way to turn a profit and take it to the next level,&#8221; Gliebe said.</p>\n<h2>Scalability</h2>\n<p>One of the largest obstacles of running a directory is scalability. In the case of Pro Plugin Directory, the submissions come directly from the plugin sellers. The <a href=\"https://proplugindirectory.com/submissions/\">Submission Guidelines</a> have certain requirements to help ensure quality content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The original content they submit is in a sense their <em>payment</em> for being listed and gaining exposure. There surely is work to be done but it will not be as heavy as <a href=\"http://themesorter.com/\">ThemeSorter</a> or similar failed plugin and theme directory endeavors. I basically click <strong>approve</strong> or <strong>reject</strong> with the way it&#8217;s setup,&#8221; Gliebe said.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SearchWPPluginListing.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44752\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SearchWPPluginListing.png?resize=1025%2C601\" alt=\"Search WP Plugin Directory Listing\" /></a>SearchWP Plugin Directory Listing\n<h2>How Success will be Measured</h2>\n<p>Without monetizing the site up front and being a new resource within the community, Gliebe tells the Tavern what metrics he&#8217;ll use to measure success.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Repeat visitors. If I see that people return to the site to find commercial plugin options then I&#8217;ll know that it is a <em>go-to</em> resource. I would also like to see search engine results for specific types of plugins return the free plugin directory at position number one and a Pro Plugin Directory category at number two, so that the user has a complete picture of his options readily available.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The Directory is Useless Without Plugin Submissions</h2>\n<p>The directory won&#8217;t become what Gliebe envisions unless commercial plugin authors <a href=\"https://proplugindirectory.com/submissions/\">submit their plugins</a>. &#8220;In order for these things to happen, the directory needs plugins. It needs a very wide selection of commercial WordPress plugins. I need the support of plugin authors above all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Gliebe is encouraged with the number of plugins already submitted to the site, he needs the directory to be the first thing people think of when searching for a commercial option.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it becomes a <em>go-to</em> place for plugin sellers to market their new plugins then it just might work. I figure, if they know about it, why wouldn&#8217;t they list their plugins? It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s easy, and I&#8217;d do it myself before other, harder, marketing tactics.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PluginSubmissionForm.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44753\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PluginSubmissionForm.png?resize=676%2C734\" alt=\"Pro Plugin Directory Submission Form\" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Submission Form\n<h2>Does it Stand a Chance?</h2>\n<p>Creating a commercial plugin directory is not a new idea. Brad Touesnard founded the WordPress App Store which tried to be a commercial plugin directory while making it easier to browse and buy plugins. It didn&#8217;t attract the number of eyeballs needed to make the business sustainable and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/brad-touesnard-explains-why-the-wp-app-store-failed\">ultimately shut down</a>.</p>\n<p>If Gliebe can&#8217;t get the support of commercial plugin authors and find a way to get a large number of plugins into the directory within a year, it will likely suffer the same fate.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jun 2015 04:38:34
